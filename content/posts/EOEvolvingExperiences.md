Summary: Taking a look at how Equinox is pulling finger print scanning and connected scales for what I think (and hope) to be an improved experience using the latest in mobile tech.

So one of the few constant luxuries I offer myself is my monthly gym membership at Equinox. It is a great experience and supports the one thing I preach -- **strong mind, strong body.** When one walks in, it is clear that Equinox is focused on premium user experiences-- clean facilities, top-notch equipment, skilled trainers, diverse classes, spa services and *generally innovative offerings using technology.*

Apart of the above effort, I was very impressed and pleased to see 1) finger print scanners to check-in; 2) online panel to monitor visits, register for classes and purchase personal training sessions;  as well as 3) a connected device in the locker rooms to check and log vitals (weight and body fat). Now, things are changing...

Last month, I realized that the location I frequent the most had it's connected scale swapped out for a traditional one (yes the ones where you slide over the weights). I was pretty sad... it was so easy to keep track of my body weight and quantify results. Then a couple weeks ago, I was told that the finger print scanners will also be done away with for an iPhone app (or a traditional barcode on my keychain)-- which I think is for the best.

While this does not impact my the core experience, it is something that adds convenience as well as support the notion that Equinox is a premium brand that embraces innovation. While they are on top of the latest in exercise science, it seems like a muddled strategy in regards to the administrative experience.

Reflecting on what was happening, it could be a variety of things, including but not limited to:

* **Cost.** Perhaps he maintenance and upkeep was more costly than I realized given they seemed to be the first ones to adopt it. Time is also important to understand, that fingerprint scanner creates lines to check in!
*  **Reliability.** The scanner and connected scale did act up at times. The scanner took multiple tries sometimes where as a simple scan was quicker-- can't argue that. More important to me, the connected scale had it's moments where it gave a hokey reading but in general was great and required no additional work (logging into a journal, etc). It used your finger print to connect to your account and tracked vitals. I will really miss it.
*  **Lack of Use.** Perhaps I am nuts and was the only one who used the connected scale? I doubt it but it could be the case that the cost did not match to the benefit.
*  **Something Better is On the Way.** Given that Equinox is offering premium experiences, perhaps there are better things on the way. I am not as hurt about the lack of finger print scanning to login but would like an Android app. It likely would be better for the business with the ability to accept mobile payments, push notifications, track location and activity with the motion processors available in our phones. The removal of the connect scale does inconvenience me and seem like a step backward. I am not sure how these new, analog scales make things better-- and they don't take body fat like the old ones. It would be great to see a more accurate device with the ease of use provided by the old one.

I love it when businesses take risks implementing new technologies and that has definitely been the case at Equinox so far. I am hoping these changes result in a more integrated, digital experience for fitness at Equinox clubs (even with my Android).
