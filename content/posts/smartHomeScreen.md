Summary: Spent sometime optimizing my home screen earlier this week and it hit me, why don't we have "smart" home screens that change based on context?

I spent the earlier part of this week not feeling well and as I was resting, I took some time to revisit my home screen. I realized that I was using certain apps more frequently than the ones on my home screen. As a result, I went on an "optimization" exercise of sorts. While I was going through the motions, it hit me, why is my home screen constant throughout the day, at all times and in every situation? Why hasn't it evolved or attempted to get "smarter" like everything else?

# The Great Battle

We are seeing more apps and constellations amid a push to "unbundle-it-all," leading us to struggling with, among other things:

1. managing the number of apps on our phone, 
2. knowing when to use each app (losing track of what each app can do),
3. unbundling offering suboptimal experiences

In an effort to keep ourselves organized, we place useful and frequently accessed apps on our home screen. The issue though, like an actual home, there's only so much room.

# The Smart Home Screen

I went through each app on my old home screen and considered three things: 1) when I used it, 2) why I used it and 3) how often I used it. Turned out that my usage varied based on day of the week, time of day, location as well as my situation. I even realized that some apps, notably, Facebook were a massive time waste given I received little value from those interactions vs. the time I spent on them.

Given that phones have sensors and ability to detect date, time and location, why couldn't it dynamically display a home screen? 

For example, I think my phone should swap out items like Buffer and Drive for Maps and TripAdvisor when it knows I'm on vacation. How does it know I'm on vacation? For one, my calendar will have that information and my location will can confirm it. Similarly, if I am commuting to work, it can display apps like maps, news, social networking and ebook reading applications on the home screen for easy access. 

Perhaps I'm the only one, but this concept seems to make sense. While execution is another issue, I feel that the revamp to basic OS components-- like notifications in iOS 8 show there is a willingness in improving the basics. The home screen has not been drastically innovated (to my memory) since the smartphone came about-- perhaps this is a feature that could be woven into future releases.
