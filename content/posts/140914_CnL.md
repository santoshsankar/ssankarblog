## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/braintree-adds-bitcoin-acceptance/" target="_blank">Braintree Adds Bitcoin Acceptance</a>**. Partnering with Coinbase, Braintree will now allow merchants to accept Bitcoin. PayPal's support is one of the <a href = "http://www.wired.com/2014/09/paypals-support-is-the-best-thing-that-could-happen-to-bitcoin/" target="_blank">better</a> things to happen for Bitcoin.

* **<a href = "http://firstround.com/article/Urbansitter-Lynn-Perkins" target="_blank">This Is How You Get People to Trust Your Product</a>**. A couple snippets- 1) “As you develop trust, you develop brand equity. That should be your goal.”, 2)“Any time a customer's hesitation is relieved by something you do, you win.” 

* **<a href = "http://www.gv.com/lib/8-shortcuts-for-better-faster-design-research" target="_blank">Google Ventures' Tips for Better, Faster, Design Research</a>**. A great list for improving efficiency and effectiveness of design research. Pretty interesting read even for those not in the design game-- helps you better understand how great apps are made.

* **<a href = "http://robgo.org/2014/09/09/tried/" target="_blank">The Pessimism of VCs- “I’ve seen this tried many times before”</a>**. An awesome piece from NextView Ventures' Rob Go on the attitude VCs have when iterating on prior technologies. It's a lazy response and one that I observe in all parts of life. If "it's" been tried before, it's ok, there's no hurt in seeing if "it's" worth trying again (equipped with the knowledge learned from previous mistakes).

* **<a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/business/international/at-alibaba-the-founder-is-squarely-in-charge.html?_r=0" target="_blank">NYT Profile of Jack Ma</a>**. Currently, Ma might be the most popular executive due to the pending IPO of BABA. Great profile from the Times-- some good fodder for lighting a fire under someone with high potential.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/61794016/clearsmile-oral-hygiene-device?ref=category_popular" target="_blank"> CLEARsmile - Oral Hygiene Device</a>**. This campaign is for an oral hygiene device that uses bubble-technology to help keep our mouths clean. It's supposed to serve as an alternative to the the toothbrush and floss. Seems interesting but I will wait to see it's success and proven ability to keep cavities away.

* **<a href = "http://www.ideamarket.com/" target="_blank">IdeaMarket</a>**. Bill Gross at IdeaLab launched IdeaMarket where people can contribute ideas, have them refined and then pair them to a founding team for execution. Major players in the inception, refinement and execution will earn equity in the venture and mentorship from IdeaLab. I'm a big fan of crowdsourcing so really appreciated this approach. Often times people have ideas but lack the resources (or will) to execute on them. With IdeaMarket that will no longer be the case. 

* **<a href = "http://airsidemobile.com/" target="_blank"> Mobile Passport</a>**. After spending 2 hours in an immigration and customs line (I have stood around longer before) this really stuck out to me. A way to use software and mobile innovations to expedite the process. Not to mention, it touches on the point of transferring our IDs into a presentable, verifiable digital medium.

* **<a href = "http://www.runswiftlang.com/" target="_blank">Run Swift</a>**. With the iOS 8 update coming next week, people are ramping up their Swift development. Personally, I'm taking a great class and beginning to execute on one of my ideas. Run Swift allows one to tinker with Swift directly in the browser.

* **<a href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whatwine/id815647459?mt=8" target="_blank">WhatWine</a>**. A spiffy iOS app that helps one choose a bottle of wine to go along with a meal. Users snap pictures of menus and the "iPhone sommelier" goes line by line to pair meals and wines.
