Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

I must say it feels like 2014 has gone by faster than any year prior to it-- already hitting the midseason mark of college football. I was in Pennsylvania visiting friends for the weekend to watch the Penn State game so wasn't able to get this out on time. Enjoy!

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/round-size-trends/" target="_blank">A Visual Look at the Evolution of the Startup Fundraising Market</a>**. A great analysis looking the evolution of fundraising pre-financial crisis to present day. It really helps to see the data broken down by round as well as in quartiles. Tunguz concludes that while Series A investment dollars are up and the number of B and C deals are lower, those companies that do get to later funding rounds command 2x the capital as before

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@ireneau/understanding-ux-skills-21ad9c22f0bf" target="_blank">Understanding User eXperience Skills</a>**. A great piece that helps one understand what "design" is and the importance of UX in building a product. It's capped off with a great Q&A related to hiring UX professionals.

* **<a href = "http://talkroute.com/got-accepted-into-techstars-turned-it-down/" target="_blank">Turning down an Invite to TechStars</a>**. I thought it was a great way to think through and weigh the decision of joining an accelerator or incubation program. Personally, such an invite is a great milestone which could setup the business for further success. The transparency around the reasoning behind rejecting the offer is excellent 

* **<a href = "http://www.geekwire.com/2014/vc-sounds-shes-bullish-portlands-startup-scene" target="_blank">The Portland Tech Scene</a>**. Take a look at the up-and-coming Portland tech scene that has attracted talent and capital from all over, especially the east coast. Diane Fraiman of Voyager Capital offers her two cents in a great Q&A- the point on capital efficiency is especially important and worth paying attention to

* **<a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/06/foundation-foursquares-product-future/?ncid=rss" target="_blank">Interview with Foursquare's Dennis Crowley</a>**. Google Ventures Partner and Founder of North, Kevin Rose hosted a great interview with Crowley. The duo discuss topics ranging from the debut of Swarm, Crowley's product vision for Foursquare, local search and consumer reviews

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kenburns/tinyscreen-a-color-display-the-size-of-your-thumb" target="_blank">TinyScreen</a>**. I shared this on Product Hunt earlier this week- a finger-sized color screen. I think as we see IoT take off, the addressable market for something like this grows. On the enterprise side, it could offer quick stats for infrastructure-related appliances, status monitor for basestations, allow simple config interfaces for drones, etc. Consumer wise it could be awesome for assembling large displays, edtech-focused toys, self-monitors, or how about a mini screen on the back of our phones?

* **<a href = "http://www.flowkey.com/en" target="_blank">Flowkey</a>**. A great app that helps one learn the piano as a total beginning. Seeing that I played piano when I was younger and have lost touch, this is something that could help me get back to music-- a relaxing and enjoyable hobby. Professionals and teachers were consulted in the development of the app

* **<a href = "https://www.getfinal.com/" target="_blank">Final</a>**. I midweek Product Hunt find and with all the payment talk, seemed fitting to share. Final focuses on payment security by not sharing a credit card number with merchants but, instead, assigning every merchant a unique number that routes to one's card. It's currently in an invite-only beta-- check it out

* **<a href = "http://signul.io/" target="_blank">Signul</a>**. Using microlocation technology and an app, based on one's location, certain actions can be triggered (sending your wife a text once you leave work). Think of this as a digital to physical IFTTT. It's funding on Indiegogo, I plan to give it a go

* **<a href = "https://www.eatmorsel.com" target="_blank">Morsel</a>**. Morsel is where chefs, cooks, bartenders, baristas, etc can share the stories related to food and drink. Several shows on Food Network and Cooking Channel do the same but why not make it social? This is awesome
