Summary: With some thought and process, one can participate in crowdfunding (no matter the amount) and contribute to interesting or promising ideas.

I love crowdfunding, this isn't news for those of you who have followed me from my Wordpress days (aside- I really need to get those old posts up). I consider crowdfunding one of the best financial innovations in recent past given that it can provide several benefits (beyond just capital) to artists, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and innovators.

It's taken many forms, from equity-focused offerings like AngelList, Crowdfunder or Fundable to more creative and product-focused platforms such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter. For the purpose of this piece, I am focusing on the latter cohort.

I think crowdfunding offers a variety of benefits, including, among other things:

* validates proofs of concept,
* finds market fit,
* helps to prevent equity dilution,
* uses creative funding mechanisms,
* generates a community of users,
* builds "free" marketing and exposure

# The Symbiotic Relationship

Ultimately, these benefits comes from the symbiotic relationship built between a product and the broad community willing to fund it. While great products lure the the masses, the benefits to these venturing innovators wouldn't be possible if they didn't have the faith of early adopters.

Last year, a few friends and I considered launching a niche crowdfunding portal but after much research and a pivot, we scrapped the idea.  Since then, I have been much more active to fund interesting and in my opinion, high potential ideas. 

# My Perspective and Process

Understanding the relationship and *necessity for risk taking by a certain percentage of the population*, I budget an amount every month to support interesting and promising efforts. While the identification really depends on where one's head's at, I tend to focus on technology-based products, efforts and innovations. The amount committed is different for everyone so it depends on a mix of one's income, financial goals and ultimately risk tolerance.

While many campaigns are structured so they don't fund until the minimum level is met, one still faces risks after the funding. Some risks that come to mind, and definitely not all of them:

* product releases and turns out to not be a hit so the inventor and team move on,
* offering is of worse quality than expected,
* tangentially related to point two, product does not do what it said it does,
* lack of support for the product,
* better competitors quickly crop up at a lower cost, 

These are just somethings a serious and serial funder should take into consideration. While there is no return per say, one does benefit from being an early adopter and getting personal satisfaction of helping others. I am blessed with a good education and job but am unable to participate in any meaningful early stage angel or VC investments. Instead, I take to these platforms to lend my support and share in success. In lieu of equity, I accept an early product or service in exchange for my financial commitment. I even attempt to offer valuable feedback and drum up support for what I am backing.

# "Just Fund It"

As you can tell, I have a method to the madness. I funnel down to what interests me and based on my monthly allocation, selectively fund things based on my interests and perceived product potential. While not everyone might be capable and/or willing to give a product a shot with a $50 or $100 check, I hope this offers some structure to those interests or on the fence.

All in all, I think a process like this brings confidence and focus with limited capital and time. In essence, this has me setup to identify something and **just fund it**.
