Summary:  I've been using Google Inbox for a few weeks now as my sole email client. All-in-all, I love it but here is a more detailed breakdown of my thoughts.

I've been using Google Inbox for a few weeks now as my sole email client. It took the spot of Gmail on my home screen and the Gmail tab in Chrome. Going into it, I have long thought that this re-nnovation of email was a long-time coming and kept an open mind with the goal of sharing feedback to help make a better product. Here are my thoughts-

## What's Awesome

1. **Material Design**. Google gets design. I think for a long time they've been focused on engineering and are coming full circle with Material Design. It's so satisfying to use Inbox from composing emails down to sliding, selecting, dragging, etc.

2. **Bundling.** Inbox bundles similar emails and presents them as a "bundle" for your review. This is the most notable feature and spurred a behavioral change in regards to how I deal with email. It is similar to the Social, Promotion "bins" in Gmail and keeps the Inbox uncluttered. It groups emails with similar themes, messages, objectives and shows it as a bundle with a one line preview of senders/message lines to help me determine when and whether to act on them.

	I'm no longer going through a ton of emails but am addressing bundles. I can determine very quickly what's important, address it then "check off" the bundle without going through numerous emails.

	One thing that's worth noting is that I actually peruse through those *other* emails now without opening any. The numerous newsletters, offers/discounts, etc that were usually hid away from my sight I can now review with great speed and even do a bulk delete/archive. For those wondering, this is probably also much more friendlier to email marketers who were ticked-off when Gmail started auto-bucketing emails away from a user's view.

3. **Email as Actions**. While I love email, I also hate it because it can end up being a chore. Answering email after email, reviewing everything to see what is important, etc. A great example of emotional design, the "checking off" of emails that have been dealt with makes me feel more accomplished. No longer will there be statements like, "*All* I did was answer the crap-ton of emails in my inbox" it will now be a statement of accomplishment. Note: I believe the check-off is the same thing as "archiving."

4. **Reminders**. The ability to integrate email and task lists is great. Email has long been a large part of a daily routine so why not include the other tasks one needs to accomplish in the most used app? The predictive text is great, I can type buy and I already have items such as milk, books, bread, eggs, et al. I would assume that this list would become more fine tuned as time goes on and Inbox understands the user better

## What Needs Another Iteration

1. **Overbundling At Times**. While I love the bundling, I found that in the first few days that there was some over-bundling occurring. For example, I was shared on a Dropbox folder that ended up in the "Updates" bundle and I had to go pluck this email out and into the main inbox. While I haven't had this issue subsequently, it is worth noting.

2. **Learn From Me**.The current system of custom bundles is very much like Gmail Labels. One can define certain emails be bundled based on sender, key words, subject line, etc. That's great for fine tuning things but I wouldn't be upset if Inbox tried to bundle things based on my previous actions. For example, for the last two weeks I've been corresponding with an individual from General Assembly. In turn, I've been assigning messages to a bundle. The emails had words like data, schedule, billing, payment and deadline. I feel that by now it would make sense for Inbox to auto-bundle them or just *attempt to.* Maybe I'm a more tolerant user but seeing its in pre-Beta, attempting this even with limited success would be ok.

3. **What About Keep**? With Reminders a core part of the new email experience, I was left to wonder what will happen to my beloved Keep. Keep is Google's task and quick notes app that paid respect to Post-Its. Keep is a bit more sophisticated than Inbox Reminders and can even allow me to label notes, group them, color them, set reminders, etc. It would be nice to see some "bundling" of reminders/tasks and incorporate Keep's functionality. 

4. **Error Prevention**. I ended up on my MacBook without any Internet and was typing an important email that required thought. I hit send and realized that I am disconnected. I luckily was able to to copy the text before the error page loaded but when I reconnected to Wi-Fi and checked my drafts, the message was not saved. While I realized there was a warning on the bottom left of the screen, it would've helped to make the notice more prominent and save the message offline

All in all, I love Inbox and plan to continue to use it. I think it has enough to distinguish it from Gmail but still familiar enough for those converting over. If you have an invite spread the love, if you need an invite, ask around or <a href= "https://www.google.com/inbox" target="_blank">request one</a>.
