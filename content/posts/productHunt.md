Summary: A look at Product Hunt and features it could add as it grows. Product Hunt is a community that surfaces the best products and allows people to share their views on the latest product discoveries.

I was reading Alex Taub's <a href ="http://alexstechthoughts.com/post/90564543181/how-producthunt-can-be-massive" target="_blank">blog</a> and he did a quick piece on <a href="http://www.producthunt.com" target ="_blank">Product Hunt</a> (PH). PH, in it's own words, "surfaces the best new products, every day. Its community of enthusiasts share and geek out about the latest product discoveries." It's been on my list of things to write about so I thought I would do the same. 

I check PH everyday and like Alex, think it has great potential. I think it helps solve the "app discovery" problem in a simple way way-- where great, upcoming products are lost among the larger app constellations in the iOS App Store or Android Play Store. Mind you, physical goods can also be "hunted" on it. It is used by many noteworthy individuals including investors, innovators and technologists looking for worthy investment opportunities or interesting applications of technology.

#Simplicity Done Well

I think besides the fact that it allows easy discovery of interesting and/or promising apps, PH leverages preexisting UI/UX concepts from the likes of HackerNews and Reddit-- emphasizing the power of simplicity. Descriptions are just a few words and the the UI, while dynamic, hinges on a single action-- a simple "up vote." 

By looking at the home screen, one can easily see which apps as a whole the PH community finds interesting, read a quick blurb and then check out the product and/or engage in dialogue with other members (limited to certain members). I love how one can just glance at the screen and know what is going on, big props to the team for that.

#What More Can Be Done?

So I went through and thought about things that could improve the experience especially as the PH gains in popularity and use. My thoughts-

* **Organization.** The lack of organization is one of PH's strengths-- in the wide world of products, who knows what is being brewed up out there? As such, I think keeping the default UI to a general, rank order based on up votes is the right approach. However, I think it would help to assign each product a category whether it is by type of app (games, productivity, entertainment, etc) or some other descriptor. This in turn can allow users to filter the products so they can quickly hone on what interests them. Can't argue with features that may help save time and increases users efficiency.
* **Comparative Curation.** Often times, apps have alternatives and currently, it is difficult to see those comparisons in one succinct manner. While this does not address the existing apps out there, it would be great to see a simple, clear layout of the products appearing on PH. It would likely help users from all walks of life, investors and those looking to adopt or try out the latest and greatest ideas. Users can see the community's sentiment and then form their own opinion on what to download, try, recommend or invest in based on their specific needs.
* **Contextal Recommendations.** I think this is likely further out in the development cycle but could be quite powerful. Based on each up vote, PH could draw conclusions on the types of products users enjoy or more importantly, types of products that users have expertise in that could result in better rankings. Furthermore, user profiles could be expanded to get more detailed information around user interests and expertise to help shape this type of intelligence.  Who knows maybe it could eventually offer a service that offers initial validation for MVPs (minimum viable products) from industry experts? 

So there it is, just a few of my thoughts and who knows, <a href="http://ryanhoover.me/">Ryan Hoover</a> and team at Product Hunt may already be at it making the aforementioned look like yesterday's ideas.
