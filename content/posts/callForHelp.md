Summary: Studying an opportunity to disrupt the way people plan their leisure and recreational activities for vacation and looking for individuals to help take part in observations/interviews/surveys.

So I embarked on an aggressive "summer of learning" to round out my business and finance skill set with more product and technical expertise. My curriculum this summer consists of:

* Stanford's <a href="https://class.coursera.org/ml-006/auth/auth_redirector?type=login&subtype=normal" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a> Course
* UCSD's <a href="https://class.coursera.org/hciucsd-005/auth/auth_redirector?type=login&subtype=normal" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction</a> Course (HCI)
* Thinkful's <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/" blank="_blank">Swift</a> Course (would appreciate the referral if you sign up)

It keeps me busy but I love how everything is hands on, that it's free (or quite affordable) and best of all, I can learn and apply immediately. As such, the HCI course requires me to do a long-term project of which the first component is due this weekend.

# The Premise

Over the years, casually observing everyone from friends, family to strangers met at airports, I have realized that planning quality travel experiences is quite difficult. There are a variety of resources that offer search, book and pay services but such offerings tend to showcase larger, mass marketed activities-- often times not reflective of he culture or region one is visiting. There are resources that curate reviews of leisure and recreational activities but often times those creates more questions than answers. They’re purpose-built to attract large amounts of reviews from "non-experts" and generally end up being cookie-cutter, mass marketed offerings. Hashing through those ranks and reviews can also be tedious and time consuming.

It's clear to me that there is an opportunity to catalyze behavioral change and innovate on this activity. As such, I am looking for opportunities to change the way individuals search, book and pay for their leisure and recreational activities while traveling.

Some of my thoughts include:

* What is currently working / not working well?
* Are there any shortcuts / "hacks" being used to get the job done?
* What if there was a way to tap into the local knowledge of the area you plan to visit?
* What if we could experience things like a local and immerse ourselves in a town's culture-- get a truly individual experience?
* What could help with the ratings and rankings overload?
* Could this process be done with the speed and intuition that a digital product should bring?

## What Else is Out There?

If you have read this far, you likely are like, okay, there has to be something out there that offers this? Yes, in some sense, this already exists. I would say my idea is most closely addressed by <a href ="https://www.vayable.com/" target="_blank">Vayable</a>. But to not bias my research work, I will say no more and allow you to experience for yourself.

# My Ask

I am looking for individuals who can spare 10-15 mins for me to observe and/or casually interview them as they seek to plan their next trip. If anyone is willing to help, please take a moment to send me an <a href="mailto:santoshsankar@gmail.com">email</a>. I will focus on user actions/behavior as well as what is working well, not working well, shortcuts or “hacks” users are taking. I will combine my findings with opportunities to leverage emerging trends, concepts and themes such as: local, the sharing economy, social. For the vast majority, given I am doing this remotely, I will just send a link to a survey.
