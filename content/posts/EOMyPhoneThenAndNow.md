Summary: I recently replaced my GS4 and reflected on my past devices as well as how my habits have changed in just four short years thanks to rapid innovation.

So I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S4 a couple weeks ago due to a broken screen and went against the wisdom of crowds by getting the LG G3. Flat out, I love it. It's totally Android and the minimal bloatware really has won me over. Everytime I buy a phone, I generally go back and think about how much things have changed since my very first Nokia 6800 from Christmas 2003 (if I recall, correctly). 

## My Previous Phones
1. Nokia 6800
2. Samsung SGH A707
3. Blackberry Bold
4. Motorola Atrix
5. Samsung Galaxy S4

And just for the record, I still have phones 1,2,4 and 5 gathering dust.

But this year, on my commute back home last week, I started thinking about how the evolution of mobile technology has changed my communication and computing habits. Just looking back to 2010 (when I finished undergrad), alone is an interesting exercise.

## The Then vs Now
* **Messaging:** SMS + BBM vs SMS + WhatsApp + Hangouts + Facebook Messenger
* **Browser:** Default Browser vs Pick Your Favorite (Chrome vs Safari vs IE vs Opera vs Firefox)
* **Email:** Gmail App vs. Gmail App (Yes! There was a Gmail App back in 2010 when I had my Bold)
* **Storage:** On-device vs. Google Drive + Dropbox (or iCloud, Box, AWS, etc)
* **Video:** YouTube, most likely on a desktop vs YouTube App + Vimeo + Vine
* **Music:** iTunes + iPod vs Spotify + iHeartRadio + Pandora
* **Social Networking:** Facebook was King vs Facebook + Twitter + LinkedIn + Pintrest + Instagram + Many More
* **Content Aggregation / Consumption:** Google Reader (or Digg, StumbleUpon, etc) vs. Feedly + Pocket + Flipboard + Nuzzle+ Twitter + Many More
* **Productivity:** Google Docs (Browser based) vs. Google Drive Suite (or iWorks, Office 365)
* **Photo Sharing:** Facebook + Flickr + Picassa vs Instagram + Google Drive + Dropbox + 500px
* **Photo Editing:** Native Editor + Desktop Software vs Instagram + VSCO
* **Sports:** Browser-based vs + ESPN + Rivals + Bleacher Report + Score
* **Maps:** Google Maps vs Google Maps (I believe this was the same deal as Gmail-- there was a native app for it)
* **Notes/Lists:** Email + Text vs Google Keep + Writeily (Android Markdown Editor) + Wunderlist

There is also a whole slew of new apps like Yo, Buffer, SlideShare, Stitcher, etc that have earned space on my phone's precious hard drive. While these do not belong to any single, discrete category, it's interesting to note, nonetheless.

While this is not an exhaustive list, these came to mind when penning this post. Isn't it crazy how platforms and ecosystems have emerged in less than a decade? Bravo. With the explosion of apps, I likely left out some popular options-- my apologies. Have you noticed similar changes in your mobile computing habits?
