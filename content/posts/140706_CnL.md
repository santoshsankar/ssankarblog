Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Hope everyone enjoyed their Fourth of July. For those on the east coast, hope you're staying dry and safe in light of Arthur. I unfortunately had to scrap my plans to visit Charlotte, NC due to the hurricane and a series of subsequent flight cancellations. Hopefully no on else had to endure the same challenges and got to spend time with friends and family.

On that note, here are this week's selection of readings.

* **<a href = "http://venturebeat.com/2014/07/02/airbnb-ceo-spells-out-the-end-game-for-the-sharing-economy-in-7-quotes/" target ="_blank">Airbnb CEO on the Sharing Economy</a>**. At the Aspen Ideas Festival, Brian Chesky of Airbnb shared his vision for the sharing economy. It's quite well thought out but yet simple enough to understand and debate with friends and colleagues. I am a big proponent of the sharing economy and believe everyone can and should be an entrepreneur- this view is at the crux of Brian's opinions. Take a read.

* **<a href = "https://blog.yourkarma.com/building-microservices-at-karma" target= "_blank">Building Microservices</a>**. A review of how Karma built out their microservice offerings. I think it is a great approach to solving big problems-- by splitting up the development into small pieces. It is tough to find actual case studies or examples in the wild so here you go.

* **<a href = "http://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/?imm_mid=0bf394&cmp=em-strata-na-na-newsltr_20140702_elist" target="_blank">An Overview of Machine Learning Algorithms</a>**. Machine learning is a hot topic now and given that I am taking a class offered by Stanford (through Coursera), thought this was relevant. It's a great way to get a macro view on the topic and potentially find a niche or area that interests you.

* **<a href = "http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528576/can-software-make-health-data-more-private/" target="_blank">Helping to Secure Health Data</a>**. A piece on how University of Illinois researchers have found a way to identify which parts of one's medical history could reveal more than intended. Basically, this will allow a patient to pick and choose what to share or reveal as medical data is increasingly digitized and passed between different players (doctors, insurance, pharmacies, etc).

* **<a href = "http://pando.com/2014/07/02/startups-anonymous-25-questions-founders-are-too-embarassed-to-ask/" target="_blank">25 Questions Founders are Embarrassed to Ask</a>**. A compilation of questions by Startups Anonymous that founders are too shy or embarrassed to ask. Some of them seem simple but are important to understand and be aware of. No such thing as a stupid question (given you have used your resources to research it first).

I hope everyone enjoys the rest of their weekend and gets home safe if they are traveling. As always, a share or retweet would be much appreciated.
