Summary: The plan for the next few weeks in regards to the design and development of the new site.
 
So after a couple weeks, I finally sat down and did not budge till I moved the site over to [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4326c62c8117). Given that we haven't been on the VPS for too long, I can't comment too much on performance but so far three things have really stood out:

* Customer service
* Speed
* The great community of self-guided tutorials

I highly recommend [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4326c62c8117) to anyone looking to make the switch... yes I do benefit if you use my referral. 

So now that this major strategic transition is down with, what's next?

1.  Make sure there is quality content shared on a consistent basis
2. Fire up Disqus for commenting
3. Include social media sharing icons
4. Personalize the design and feel using Bootstrap 3
5. Migrate the old posts from the Wordpress configuration
6. Open up an area for portfolio and side projects

So over the next few weeks expect these changes to slowly take form. Have a great Saturday!
