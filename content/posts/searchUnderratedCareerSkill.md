Summary: Search, whether it's a Google query, email filters, CRM search or manipulating large data sets, is an important and necessary skill to develop even if it's not formally taught.

This past weekend, I had some of my friends from college up for a NYC summer weekend. In addition to food and drink, we enjoyed the sights and sounds in the mild weather and took in the melting pot that is NYC. During one of our conversations, my one friend who left teaching to pursue a corporate job at a small defense contractor was explaining how she has been Googling everything she doesn't know. 

The rest of us looked around and took a moment to reflect. Despite working in different companies of various sizes in different industries and functions, we all agreed on one thing, "search," in general, is the most useful skill at work, regardless of where one works.

The most important thing in a job is to be able to learn, apply and execute to effectively and efficiently get a task done. Search, in various forms allows us to do get things done. Whether it's a Google search to look up an acronym, sifting through email or querying a CRM for client details and meeting minutes, searching is a skill. It may seem stupid but being able to search is a skill that one develops the more they do it. The concept of search also extends beyond the Internet to data sets in Excel, large company databases as well as visualization of our findings. 

It's something that I have relied on since my first internship. Along with what was called an "intern notebook," I was told to Google every question I had before asking a senior. While this might seem cold or harsh, it really helped further develop how to formulate queries, learn Google syntax and have an approach to finding complex sets of data, information and augmenting my knowledge. Given I started off in investment banking, I also become quickly comfortable with large data sets and visualization techniques in Excel.

For those with interns this summer or responsible for helping to develop junior talent, take some time to reinforce this skill. Start small and then illustrate and encourage exploration in areas like basic data analysis with Excel, learning a useful language like R, Python or maybe tools like Octave or Matlab (useful for machine learning). For those more interested in visuals, training with tools like Tableau, SAS or graphing add-ins could be useful.
