Summary: My views on Reddit announcing preliminary plans to attempt to create a cryptocurrency that is backed by its own equity.


Reddit <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/30/reddit-scoops-up-50m-series-b-from-sam-altman-a16z-sequoia-at-500m-valuation/?ncid=rss" target="_blank">announced</a> a $50M Series B round along with preliminary plans to attempt to create a cryptocurrency that is backed by the equity of Reddit.

CEO Yishan Wong's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2hwpmm/fundraising_for_reddit/ckwph30" target="_blank">thoughts</a> on the subject:

>We are thinking about creating a cryptocurrency and making it exchangeable (backed) by those shares of reddit, and then distributing the currency to the community. The investors have explicitly agreed to this in their investment terms.

>Nothing like this has ever been done before. Basically we have to nail down how to do each step correctly (it is technically, legally, and financially complex), though in our brief consultation with an ex-SEC lawyer, he stated he could find nothing illegal about this plan. Nevertheless, there are something like 30 different things we have to pull off to make this work, so we're going to try.

>(Also, I know this totally contradicts what I said over here but that was before Sam proposed this plan to me, and the idea of being able to distribute ownership of reddit back to the community - a long-held dream of many of us, frankly - is important enough to try and do this)

>Again, we want to emphasize that this plan is in its earliest stages right now and could totally fail (if it does, we will find another way to get the shares to the community somehow), but we are going to try it because... well, because we are reddit and we do these kinds of things.

## My Thoughts

I'm not here to make a judgement given this is just an idea but want to share my thinking when I heard the news.

* **Is this exactly cryptocurrency?** Currently, this idea doesn't seem to exactly be a cryptocurrency given that it doesn't use cryptography to secure and validate transactions, and create new units. This leads me to my next point... (My quick definitional reference <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)

* **Just a structured equity derivative?** It seems like *the end goal is to to make sure reddit users receives equity in the community*. I like this idea, it really turns it into an online democracy of sorts-- a community by the users, for the users. However, is this just a way to creatively distribute shares to users? Based on the opinion of the lone lawyer, there like won't be any requirements for extensive documentation, limits on the number of shareholders, no reporting requirements, etc. Furthermore, it's backed by reddit shares (it's value is derived from reddit shares)-- aren't Reddit shares ultimately valued in dollars? The value in dollars could be rendered moot if merchants are able (and willing) to accept "Redcoin" for products and services.

* **How many cryptocurrencies do we need?** At this point some folks might be like, why do we need another cryptocurrency or something of the sort? I believe that we're still in the early innings of this cryptocurrency stuff. I think like with most technologies, we're in an exploration phase. Innovators are considering/exploring all alternatives, leveraging the strengths of core concepts (like blockchain), usage (like Dodgecoin funding the Jamaican olympic team), adoption scenarios, etc. 

As it relates to reddit, it seems like the mission at hand is to distribute a portion of the upside benefits of the community to the users that have made it-- I like that. Users collect, curate and interact with the content on the site (unpaid employees) which has helped put reddit in the position it currently is in. Why shouldn't ecosystems and communities allow users to have a small (10% really isn't much) financial ownership?

On the point of cryptocurrencies, even if a "Redcoin" (or whatever it might be called) doesn't materialize, ultimately this is healthy and benefits the broader cryptocurrency movement by validating/disvalidating certain concepts, approaches and structures.
