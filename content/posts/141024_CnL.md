Getting out Coffee & Links early this week as I head down to my alma mater for a weekend of football (and a much needed get-a-way from NYC). 

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status= http://goo.gl/Ex58xZ" target="_blank">share</a> this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://tiempoapp.com/y-combinator-a-two-year-old-and-a-pregnant-wife" target="_blank">Balancing a Startup, Two-Year Old, Pregnant Wife and Being in Y Combinator</a>**.  This is an extreme case of work/life integration but something I wish managers would read. I regularly clock 12 or more hours and am not even building a business from scratch (yet) -- and I don't have a family! I feel like in an effort to please superiors, managers (especially those not doing all the lifting) tend to not prioritize or apply a "1" to all tasks-- essentially sacrificing their employees. Anyways, a good read and props to Tad for figuring it out

* **<a href = "http://blog.semilshah.com/2014/10/18/the-three-push-notification-taxes/" target="_blank">The Three "Taxes" of Push Notifications</a>**. Using Push notifications effectively has been a difficult proposition. When Yo launch early this year, notifications got more attention and people started to revisit push notifications. iOS 8 even offers some extra functionality like inline replies. This piece takes a look at the three challenges (or areas of opportunity) of push notifications

* **<a href = "http://mashable.com/2014/10/21/indian-tech-startups/" target="_blank">Top Indian Startups to Watch</a>**. Timely publication given it's Diwali, but an important market to understand. The second largest nation in the world is slowly becoming home to a variety of innovative startups. Mashable has a list of a few that caught their eye

* **<a href = "http://www.wired.com/2014/10/algorithms-wearable-tech-frontier/?utm_content=buffer5eaf0&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank">Algorithms for Wearables</a>**. Data is going to drive the differentiation and value-add in the wearables market. As such, algorithms will play a role in improving data capture, analysis and presentation

* **<a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/21/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-shares-his-vision-for-the-future-of-bitcoin/" target="_blank">Coinbase CEO's Vision for the Future of Bitcoin</a>**. Armstrong shares his views on Bitcoin and thoughts on the future of it. He touches on the user base, merchant adoption, transaction volumes, developer community as well as the regulatory environment

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/142464853/hendo-hoverboards-worlds-first-real-hoverboard" target="_blank">Hendo Hoverboard</a>**. Yes, a hoverboard. I think that alone warrants a look. Hendo is crowdfunding right now and thr $299 cost could be worth it for the Whitebox dev kit if you are that excited about hovering around

* **<a href = "https://realtimeboard.com/" target="_blank">Browser-based Whiteboard</a>**. I love whiteboards and even installed one in my room for my flowcharts and quick wireframes. This web-based app offers a similar experience with the added benefit of collaboration

* **<a href = "https://www.robinhood.com/" target="_blank">Robinhood</a>**. A zero-commission stock trading platform, Robinhood makes it more affordable to invest. Currently, users can trade most major US stocks and funds through the app. Thought it would be interesting for those looking for a no cost solution

* **<a href = "http://www.customvine.com/" target="_blank">CustomVine</a>**. I thought this was pretty cool-- it allows customers to create their own wines. From the sourcing, production through to branding and fulfillment, CustomVine has a solution. Basically helps one start their own wine label without a full blown operation. Vineyard-as-a-Service?

* **<a href = "http://www.luxevalet.com/" target="_blank">Luxe Valet</a>**. On-demand valet and parking service. Using your phone, request a valet to pick up your car and park it in a secure lot for $5/hour. They will even wash and fuel 'er up! It's only available in San Fran right now but heaven knows NYC (and other major cities) could use it
