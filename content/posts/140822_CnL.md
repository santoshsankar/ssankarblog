## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2014/08/12/mobile-os-paradigm/" target="_blank">Mobile OS Paradigm</a>**. By the former President of Windows and current A16Z Partner, Steven Sinofsky-- a must read. "The mobile OS as defined by Android, iOS, Windows RT, Chrome OS, Windows Phone, and others is a very different architecture from the PC as envisioned by Windows 7/8, Mac OS X, Linux desktop. The paradigm includes a number of key innovations that when taken together define the new paradigm."

* **<a href = "http://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/blogs/turning-mobile-wallet-economics-on-its-head/?utm_source=NetWorld+Alliance&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=EMNAMPT08202014" target="_blank">Rethinking Mobile Wallet Economics</a>**. Related to my post earlier this week about opting for my phone over my wallet, this seems quite timely. Written by Ed Busby, former CCO of Isis Mobile Wallet, this piece suggests that wallet devs should consider courting consumer companies, POS providers as well as coupon distributors.

* **<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9hb0EKAcro&list=UU0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A" target="_blank">"Bitcoin is the Libertarian Solution to the Money Enigma."</a>** An interview <a href = "http://cdixon.org/2014/08/13/bitcoin-is-the-currency-the-internet-deserves-and-needs/" target="_blank">shared</a> originally by Chris Dixon of A16Z, of George Gilder. Gilder is a known for his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596988096/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_1?pf_rd_p=1535523722&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0786100109&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=198W9SCE5437XT7B8SZD" target="_blank">Wealth and Poverty</a> that advanced the case of supply-side economics and capitalism during the Reagan Administration. 

* **<a href = "http://www.tomtunguz.com/consumer-saas-capital-efficiency/" target="_blank">Consumer or SaaS</a>**. Tunguz explores the financial details between founding a consumer or SaaS startup. An analysis around specific growth and cost dynamics accompanies the visuals.

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/founder-stories/the-idea-funnel-9bd554bedce0" target="_blank">The Idea Funnel</a>**. I really like this concept of an idea funnel. I speak with a lot of my friends that read my views and share their ideas for apps and businesses but don't know what to focus on. Nothing wrong with having many ideas, in fact this is encouraged (I probably have like 25 right now) but use the concept of the funnel to help channel your efforts.

* **<a href = "http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/08/20/best-startups-y-combinator/" target="_blank">10 Startups From Y Combinator Demo Day</a>**. I could not, not have an extra read especially the week of Y Combinator Demo Day. Check out TNW's Top 10.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://tweetstorm.io/" target="_blank">Tweetstorm.io</a>**. A tweetstorm is a series of 5-15 tweets that are sent in quick succession. This online utility helps to better read and compose tweetstorms.

* **<a href = "http://zenamins.com/" target="_blank">Zenamins</a>**. I'm quite health conscious and the health nut in me found this interesting. Zenamins ships daily doses of vitamins to a customer based on what their needs. One can either choose their vitamins or get help to figure out what they need.

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fuzdesigns/noke-the-worlds-first-bluetooth-padlock" target="_blank">Noke</a>**. Dubbed as the first bluetooth padlock, Noke allows one to use their phone to lock/unlock padlocks. Having used a combination padlocks since middle school, I know what it feels like when you forget a combo or misplace keys. I haven't funded this (I only have one padlock these days) but could be great for bikers, traveling or students.

* **<a href = "http://bitfountain.io/course/complete-ios8/" target="_blank">The Complete iOS 8 Course</a>**. An online course on iOS 8 and Swift that will launch as soon as iOS 8 is release to the public. For a limited time, one can get the course for <a href="http://bitfountain.io/course/complete-ios8/?couponCode=presale" target="_blank">$79</a>.

* **<a href = "http://www.draftin.com" target="_blank">Draftin</a>**. I've used DraftIn as part of my blogging work flow for the last few weeks. I realized I never shared it but **I love it**. It is currently free (and ad free) but that could change as more people use it. It allows for collaborative editing and version control that is extremely helpful and simple to use.
