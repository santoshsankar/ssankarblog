Summary: One thing I have always envied of Europe is the open Wi-Fi. Would open Wi-Fi be a bad thing? While it could be sold, offering it for free or low cost could benefit multiple parties.

My Irish Adventures were great and full of amazing sights and sounds. On the technology front, one thing I have always envied of Europe is the open Wi-Fi. Ireland was no different. While we were not stuck to our phones, for a group of 20-somethings, connectivity was important as we recharged in our hostel rooms and had a good crack at the pubs.

It made me think how tough traveling might be in the US for Europeans. Heck, I am used to not having Wi-Fi everywhere and I still hate tracking down Wi-Fi hotspots when traveling or trying to work at places around the city. Would open Wi-Fi be a bad thing?

The capitalist in me cringes at the thought of giving away something that could be sold but it might not be a bad idea. I would even be open to something cheap like a dollar surcharge per visit for use.

## My Thinking

I feel that telcos would appreciate offloading some of the traffic from their wireless network and in some metropolitan areas even welcome routing traffic through wirelines. Maybe I am wrong here but nothing implies otherwise.

Telcos could partner with small businesses like cafes, bars and restaurants to offer Wi-Fi. I think this arrangement could work in one of two ways:

1. **Free.** This is pretty simple, the benefit for the telcos is that wireless is less burdened with data-heavy applications.

2. **Low Cost.** Not rocket science but perhaps with the coffee, one could pay $1.00 for unlimited Wi-Fi for the duration of their visit. Not a bad deal and one could likely assume the internet service provider pockets most of that internet charge.

Simplistically, I believe that more people online will spur an increase in the exchange of ideas, improve productivity and likely result in more online transactions, among other things. The positive impact should ripple through to benefit multiple stakeholders across all socioeconomic classes. 

Just my two cents, maybe I'm wrong but one can't hate the free Wi-Fi across the pond.
