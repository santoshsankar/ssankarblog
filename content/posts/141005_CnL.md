Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Penn State was on bye this week so I had the opportunity to crush some Swift code and also visit the Smorgasburg in Brooklyn for some great food and drink. Hope everyone enjoyed their weekend and was able to get outside. If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=http://goo.gl/czRS1g" target="_blank">share</a> this with your family and friends along with a personal message.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@DanielleMorrill/is-my-startup-burn-rate-normal-882b2bd20f02" target="_blank">Is My Startup Burn Rate Normal?</a>**. With all the discussion around burn rates, Mattermark has opened the kimono as it relates to its cash burn and runway (money in the bank). Many other founders have joined in on the discussion with a transparent take on sharing the cash burn, revenue and runway metrics of their businesses.

* **<a href = "http://paulgraham.com/before.html" target="_blank">Before the Startup</a>**. A new Paul Graham essay inspired by his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii1jcLg-eIQ" target="_blank">lecture</a> at Stanford. Graham outlines the key things one must do in preparation to start, a startup. It's a great exercise to reflect on Graham's points as they touch on the way people think, perceive, develop themselves, strategize and operate. I found this footnote particularly hilarious-- "[4] What should you do if your true calling is gaming the system? Management consulting."

* **<a href = "http://www.feld.com/archives/2014/09/mentors-618-best-mentor-relationships-eventually-become-two-way.html" target="_blank">The Best Mentor Relationships are Two-Way</a>**. I read this the on subway home the other night and found myself nodding and agreeing. This is a must read for any mentor or mentee, formal or informal. Read <a href="http://goo.gl/xilcwn" target="_blank">my thoughts</a> on being an effective mentor.

* **<a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/30/general-catalyst-commits-10m-for-startups-to-stripes-payments-ecosystem/" target="_blank">Capital's Coming to Support the Stripe Ecosystem</a>**. General Catalyst has opened up an allocation of capital to help support the Stripe ecosystem. Stripe offers APIs to allow any app to accept credit card payments with its most recent win in Apple Pay (over PayPal).

* **<a href = "http://knprnews.org/post/tony-hsieh-i-was-never-downtown-projects-leader" target="_blank">Thoughts on the Layoffs at Downtown Project</a>**. Zappo's CEO Tony Hsieh started the Downtown Project to renew downtown Las Vegas by injecting technology, innovation and offering opportunities for small business establishment. This past week, they laid off a large chunk of their staff (30 people). Listen to KNPR's broadcast on the topic headlined by Sarah Lacy (founder of Pando).

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.dipjar.com/" target="_blank">DipJar</a>**. Brought to you from <a href = "http://www.alleywatch.com/2014/09/nyc-startup-dipjar-raises-420k-seed-round-to-make-sure-your-barista-isnt-short-changed/" target="_blank">Silicon Alley</a>, DipJar allows one to use their credit card to tip their baristas. I've been using this for a year or so now at the Pushcart Coffee on the corner 22nd and 2nd. I love it and from my observations, almost everyone who uses a card likely will "dip into the jar."

* **<a href = "https://ello.co" target="_blank">Ello</a>**. I cannot help to chuckle whenever I see Ello since it's my go-to line when trying to mimic my British friends. Ello has got a lot of press in the last two weeks and is cited as the "Facebook" killer. It's currently in beta so request an invite and judge for yourself.

* **<a href = "http://www.latergram.me/" target="_blank">Latergram.me</a>**. While a #latergram refers to one posting a picture taken previously, Latergram.me allows one to schedule their posts for later. Not sure people plan their posts ahead of time (I think IG use is spur-of-the-moment) but it could help if you're advertising through Instagram.

* **<a href = "http://www.gymtrack.co/" target="_blank">Gymtrack</a>**. A series of sensors that can help track every motion/movement at the gym (especially weightlifting). It provides auditory feedback which serves as a basis for a virtual personal trainer. It's still in beta but could be coming to a gym near you.

* **<a href = "http://google.github.io/physical-web/" target="_blank">Physical Web by Google</a>**. Google is pioneering a platform for the Internet of Things. While this is not an official Google Product, it could be interesting to read through for both developers and non developers.
