Summary: Innovation in outmoded, but important, basic-level or "build block" products and services are laying the foundational support for tomorrow's innovative ideas.

Attending a MeetUp that I had arranged for my HCI course a couple weeks ago, I was able to listen to and share in interesting conversations around everyone's innovative and useful ideas for the class. The ideas and discussions led me to an interesting observation- *innovation in outmoded, but important, basic-level or "build block" products and services are laying the foundational support for tomorrow's innovative ideas.*

Similar to what advances in manufacturing, material sciences and components (transistors, capacitors, batteries, etc) have done for computing devices, basic (and often times unsexy) processes have been retooled or reinvented to the benefit of newer products and services.

These are basic but time consuming and costly functions like shipping/moving, storage, payments, support and servicing, among others have been made *simple and economical* by a broad array of start ups. **Their solutions can be incorporated and leveraged in emerging products and operational models at an attractive cost.** 

These companies have solved basic problems and developed foundational process support in areas like shipping, low-cost payment processing or inventory management. This allows entrepreneurs, designers, developers, product managers, etc to focus on creatively solving problems, designing service offerings and optimizing the human-computer process and flow. 

During the Meetup, one of the attendees wanted to create a bartering marketplace for a specific niche, facilitated with a mobile app. But was worried about the verification, storage, shipping and fulfillment functions. A few years ago this could have rendered the idea moot due to it's dependence on shipping and storage (historically, high cost and low flexibility) but it's *now possible.* 

Over the last 12-24 months (perhaps longer in some cases), many of these necessary functions have been addressed by an ecosystem of start ups with [Fill It In]-as-a-Service offerings. These businesses have addressed large markets with slow-moving, high cost incumbents and are well on their way to success.

## Refreshing the Outmoded- Interesting Innovators

* **Shyp.** When I heard the participant's the idea, Shyp was the first start up that came to mind. Shyp offers low-cost, on-demand packing and shipping services all through a mobile app. Aside from bartering, Shyp can take responsibility for all shipping and logistics processes for any business that requires it. It has allowed artisans on Etsy to fulfill orders, eBay merchants to have low shipping costs and could even be a strategic partner for hardware start ups, help boutiques expand across regions or even turn grandma's knitting into supplemental income.
 
* **MakeSpace.** While this is currently a consumer offering, MakeSpace makes self-storage easy. With a fleet of trucks and warehouses, MakeSpace picks up one's things and stores it in low cost warehouses away from large, space-constricted cities. In NJ, it shares the same warehouses occupied by the likes of Polo Ralph Lauren, DKNY and Michael Kors. At $25/ month for 3 cubic feet, a nominal cost/additional bin and $29 deliveries, it saves users time and headache. But for startups, this could be a great and effective inventory solution, especially as MakeSpace grows beyond the NYC area. A founder could make their products, or purchase supplies in bulk and store them in a cost efficient manner. The time saved could be used to focus on core functions like product, business development, sales or marketing. Space and cost of inventory are less of headache or barrier.

* **Helpful.** A product from the Assembly community, Helpful is a customer support system that charges by volume of inquiries. This unique pricing model is great for upstarts. While great design is supposed to make using products simple and easy, questions unquestionably arise. Helpful allows entrepreneurs to field them, whereby building customer contact, understanding customer needs and driving meaningful improvements. Integrated with a CRM, this could really improve upon the current customer care offerings or better yet, be the pieces of the puzzle for an on-demand customer service platform.

* **Stripe.** This was my late addition but I do not know how I could leave this out. Stripe has allowed anyone and everyone to accept payments through the use of their API. With their broad adoption, many third-party tools have cropped up to help with automation, analysis, identity theft, fraud detection, etc. Having over $120mm in funding, Stripe is by far the largest name here and in my opinion, has reached a fraction of it's potential. Given the importance of payments, this was a must on this list.

While there are plenty of great ideas and players in the space, these have left a lasting mark on me. Just like in building a home, you need a solid foundation with the essential wiring and plumbing-- these "basic building block" partners provide that. I think many of them will see success as they offer their customers and partners the support they need to "build mansions."
