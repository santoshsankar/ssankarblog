Summary: Part of a product manager's responsibilities is to clearly understand the product, business, and economic impact of their decisions. Operational and financial models are often used to help aid with this-- after five years on Wall Street, here are some of my thoughts on the process of modeling.

I am working hard to shift into a broader, more product-centric role in the near future and a big part is identifying my strengths so I can contribute from day one. Part of a product manager's responsibilities is to use modeling to understand the product, business, and economic impact incremental product and/or feature ideas might have. 

Having spent the last five years with my nose in financial models, scenario analysis, and business analysis, I thought I would share some of my thoughts.. 

* **Know what's important, what's not.** From the on-set, make sure you know what your team values (and doesn't) and the philosophical belief behind what drives the business. The worst feeling is to build out a complex spreadsheet only having to break it because the basic methodology and thinking isn't aligned with the team. In my early days, I often times had to rebuild the revenue and cost drivers after speaking with fellow team members and the client 

* **Modeling is a way of thinking.** When I open a blank spreadsheet, I let things flow freely and use it as a way to get some organization around my thinking. Modeling is supposed to help you see the impact of moving parts. As such, the focus should be to account for the key drivers and the method by which they impact key metrics

* **Make assumptions and move on.** I find people who often times spend days trying to justify their assumptions. A couple points here: 1) strive to quickly make assumptions that are supported by empirical data, 2) sit down with your broad team to vet the assumptions-- don't try to do it all yourself. Odds are, you do *not know* -- and those operational risks are what all stakeholders can focus on

* **Account for details but don't "spin your wheels".** I love bottom-up analysis where you can go to *reasonable detail* to show how a new product or features impacts the broader business. When thinking about the details, think about modeling the unit-level components that will drive the sales and expense lines. Don't lump tiers or features but break them out and try to estimate them with a reasonable degree of confidence. A simple example- the addition of a new feature might cost $x but open up a sizeable market which could drive MAUs, which in turn, based on an assumption, drive $y of incremental in-app purchases

* **Always build scenarios.** People always ask "what-if" and frankly, when I'm thinking through a business, I think it's important to "stress" it to see how bad things could reasonably get

* **It's iterative.** I often times get frustrated by this but this is an iterative process. As more experience and information is gained, and telemetry is embedded into the operations of the business, assumptions will be refined and business understanding will improve. Essentially, the iterations will show how and where the business is being derisked

* **Use common sense.** The model outputs are great but use common sense when making decisions. Every situation is different and the model is just a guidepost to help with decision-making

Hope this helps those unfamiliar with spreadsheet modeling and would love to hear any feedback/experiences others have had.
