Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Had quite a busy week-- spent my weekend (attempting) to catchup ahead of my Irish vacation. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I will be able to finish out my HCI class as I had wanted. But on the flipside, I finished most of it, learned a ton and am eating up my Swift class from Thinkful. Have a great Sunday! As always, a share or like is much appreciated. Enjoy!

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://www.mondaymorningvc.com/when-co-founders-become-sunk-costs/" target="_blank">When Co-Founders Become Sunk Costs</a>**. MMVC is a great blog written by a fellow PSU alum and former PSU QB. Paul does an awesome job relating his experiences as a VC to his time in collegiate sports as well as current events occurring in a variety of athletics. This post addresses the difficult decision a CEO faces when having to fire a co-founder who isn't performing at a suitable level.

* **<a href = "http://venturegeneratedcontent.com/2014/08/14/the-only-way-to-raise-money-make-them-believe/" target="_blank">Emotion Leads to VC Investments</a>**."There are many perceived reasons for why VCs make investment decisions.  But the reality is that itâ€™s actually emotion that leads most VCs to invest."

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/customer-success-why-now/" target="_blank">Customer Success</a>**. Discussion about how customer success is an integral part of the SaaS business model. Due to more frequent renewals and the fact the buyer is no longer a CTO or CIO but lower on the chain/closer to the user, customer success and happiness is of utmost importance.

* **<a href = "http://recode.net/2014/08/12/new-youtube-boss-susan-wojcicki-talks-talent-music-and-ma-qa/" target="_blank">Meet the New Queen Cheese of YouTube</a>**. Q&A from Re/code on all things YouTube. Covers the transition, exciting projects and initiatives as well as balancing work/personal life as an executive. 

* **<a href = "http://www.inc.com/morgen-newman/5-things-to-consider-before-leaving-your-job-for-your-startup.html?cid=sf01001" target="_blank"> 5 Things to Consider Before Leaving for a Startup</a>**. With more people looking to leave their job for a startup, I think this is quite relevant. While some of these things might have a "duh" factor, to me, they are still important to reflect on.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.farmigo.com/" target="_blank">Farmigo</a>**. I feel like a ton of food-related upstarts are gaining traction as of late. Farmigo operates in the SF and NY areas, currently and helps one source products and ingredients from local farms. Given I always make time to explore farmers markets, I found this to be really cool.

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/zcan-wireless-the-world-s-first-wireless-scanner-mouse" target="_blank">Zcan Wireless</a>**. This mouse is more than your desktop mouse, it's a scanner. It not only captures printed information but also makes it searchable! I'm considering taking part in the effort and maybe even getting one for my sister (ships in time for Christmas). It's probably awesome for college with all those handwritten notes.

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/super-famicom-k1-console-killer" target="_blank">Super Famicon K1</a>**. I found this two days after it began funding at it was still at $0 vs a $5,000 goal. Famicon is based on the Nvidia Tegra K1 processor packaged in an old school form factor. The Tegra K1 boards even allow for wireless controllers. It runs Ubuntu and is capable of emulating 14+ systems including Sega, SNES, N64, Playstation and even PC games. I'm seriously considering this purchase-- "a blast to the past."

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/maximuslife-goal-setting-made-visual-digital-and-fun-for-life-work" target="_blank"> </a>**. This really resonated with my HCI class' theme around "glance" designs. Visually setting and stating goals (both career and personal) with motivation, feedback/support and rewards through an app. For fitness goals, Maximus is launching with Mifit Shine as a partner. The campaign in and of itself also seems to be well designed with full details on the idea, a team and well-thought out rewards for supporters. Check it out.

* **<a href = "http://www.google.com/edu/classroom/" target="_blank">Google Classroom</a>**. Emerging out of a closed beta, Google released it's Classroom product for the masses. I've always been interested in ed tech so this naturally caught my attention. Classroom helps teachers focus on teaching by offering collaboration tools, assignment tracking, feedback and communication utilities. I know several of my teacher friends who use Google Docs in the traditional sense but need to see if any use these education-specific models.
