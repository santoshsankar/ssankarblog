Summary: Despite a myriad of players already working on reinventing age-old industries and businesses, large opportunities still exist as antiquated industries are in a dire need of a refresh.

In the last five years we've all tried to do something and hit certain roadblocks only to go, "it should be easier than this" or "you think they would've been able to figure this out." While these statements often times come from the ignorant (those who don't understand the challenges with invention, innovation, and building business), there is some truth to these statements.

If we think about the instances where these "moments of feedback occur", it's highly likely an antiquated industry and/or business model is involved. Examples include: banking, insurance, financial planning, household legal services, internet and wireless service, public transportation, logistics/moving, customer service, apparel, healthcare, retail, etc. The list could go on forever.

These businesses have had minimal innovation or retooling over their 100 year+ existence. How could that be? Well, let's dig in more:

1. They are capital intensive
2. The industry is likely controlled by a few large, well-funded, well-established players
3. High degree of bundling (ex: financial services, cable/telco, utilities)
4. High regulatory and compliance costs
5. The incremental market opportunity is unknown or too big of a focus
6. The offerings are "good enough" or come with high switching costs
7. Related to #6, there's a lack of viable substitutes
8. In some instances, size could help with pricing power but not always the case

However, in the last several years, we've seen upstarts take a crack at "refreshing" these age-old industries with new, lean, responsive, and business models. Frankly, to me, disruption, as a word, implies displacing an existing, aged competitor(s). Examples include: Lending Club (lending), Shyp (shipping and logistics), Oscar (health insurance), Robinhood (wealth management), Groove (customer service), Bellhops (moving), Betabrand (apparel), 23andMe (healthcare), Classpass (fitness-focused retail)-- the list goes on.

Despite a myriad of players already working on reinventing age-old industries and businesses, large opportunities still exist as antiquated industries are in a dire need of a refresh.
