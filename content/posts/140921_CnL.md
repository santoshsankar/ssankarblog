Hello from Charlotte, The Queen City. I'm down here for a wedding this weekend so thought I would share a few facts.

Charlotte is home to several Fortune 500 companies- Bank of America, Wells Fargo (East Coast operations), Duke Energy, Nucor, Family Dollar, Sonic Auto, Lowe's and Domtar to name a few. The friendly business environment has also resulted in a growing crop of accelerators, angels, coworking centers, innovation centers and community events. Noteworthy mentions: Packard Place, Area 15, IncuSeed Ventures, Queen City Forward, RevTech Labs, and Ventureprise. Additionally, Raleigh, NC has long been a hub for technology and located less than 3 hours away, helps boost Charlotte's case as an emerging center for innovation.

Now on to this week's Coffee & Links- as always, a share is much appreciated!

The hot topic of the week. Are VCs assuming too much risk on the basis that cash burn levels are at highs not seen since 1999?

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@DanielleMorrill/i-have-a-hunch-about-vc-risk-6b68a9d84070" target="_blank">Hunch About VC Risk</a>**. A must read. Morrill is the CEO/Founder of Mattermark and offers her two cents as it relates to Gurley's thoughts that cash burn is high among start ups, in turn elevating the risks VCs have assumed. Many VCs have also chimed in. <a href="http://santoshsankar.com/posts/2014/Sep/17/a-tale-of-two-markets/" target="_blank">Here</a> is my follow up related to piece.

* **<a href = "http://blog.sephiroth.it/2014/09/16/why-its-hard-to-find-android-developers/" target="_blank">Why It's Hard to Find Android Devs</a>**. Being a die-hard Android user who is learning iOS development, this was interesting. It's not news that apps come to iOS first then Android but I am increasingly finding a lower volume of interesting apps. A big reason, among other things is that there are less developers out there for the platform.

* **<a href = "http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/15/ways-to-think-about-watches" target="_blank">Thoughts on Watches</a>**. Ben Evans of A16Z offers his thoughts on smart watches including their uses, market opportunity and appeal to consumers.

* **<a href = "http://www.inc.com/magazine/201406/tom-foster/lolly-wolly-doodle-explosive-growth-from-facebook-sales.html" target="_blank">The Story of Lolly Wolly Doodle </a>**. This is an awesome piece on a North Carolina e-Commerce startup focused on children's clothes. It's a few months old but I just stumbled upon it during my flight when I was perusing an old magazine. Really makes you think about the opportunities.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.eatwith.com/" target="_blank"> EatWith</a>**. Ah how I love food and food-related upstarts. EatWith allows one to dine in homes around the world to take in cuisine and culture with some new friends. Basically, it turns your home into a small-time restartaunt. 

* **<a href = "http://www.digit.co" target="_blank">digit</a>**. Digit headlined the new additions I made to my internet services list this week. Using big data (cliche), digit analyzes one's spending record (from a checking account) and helps then automatically helps save money based on spending patterns. Afraid of overdrafting? No problem! Digit is so confident in their math that they will cover overdraft expenses and then some. Check it out!

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1740411623/duoscreen-your-laptops-missing-half?ref=category" target="_blank">DuoScreen</a>**. My biggest gripe about my MacBook is the lack of dual monitors. Well, low and behold, DuoScreen is a compact second screen for laptops. Give it a look-- I might consider funding this one.

* **<a href = "https://store.dji.com/product/phantom-2" target="_blank">Phantom 2</a>**. I REALLY WANT THIS-- an unmanned aerial system for enthusiasts. Retailing at over $550 for a basic model, I have yet to justify it but maybe it could be a nice Christmas present?

* **<a href = "http://startupclass.samaltman.com/" target="_blank">Startup Class with Sam Altman of Y Combinator</a>**. This is not a product in the traditional sense but I had to share it. Sam Altman will be teaching a class at Stanford this fall and simultaneously offering it for anyone and everyone. It's 20 videos featuring successful leaders in the VC and startup space. If anyone wants to join me as I progress through the class, feel free to shoot me an email.
