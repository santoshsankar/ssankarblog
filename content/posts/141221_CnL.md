Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Finished some last-minute Christmas shopping this weekend at the Union Square Christmas Market and two of my best friends got engaged-- I think that's a great weekend.

Separately, I shared <a href="http://www.sleepinatree.co" target="_blank">The Treehouse Project</a> a month ago here and I'm happy to say they beat their Kickstarter goal and are on track to open their first luxury tree house (with full gigabit ethernet and more in March).

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please share this with your family and friends.

Despite being a year old, this is a pretty interesting memo from an industry insider. Spiegel details why he's not on the Facebook bandwagon and how he thinks Snapchat can do better

* **<a href = "http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2014/12/15/how-not-to-let-the-crazy-in.html" target="_blank">How Not to Let the Crazy In</a>**. While this is a list of how to kill stress as a startup founder, the fundamentals apply to other professions too. Things like working out, sleeping, time management, understanding your strengths, etc are applicable to all careers. A good read into the New Year

* **<a href = "http://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/12/15/erin-glenn-alphaworkss-new-ceo-waiting-sec/" target="_blank">Patience is a Virtue for Crowdfunding Players</a>**. This interview with Erin Glenn, CEO of Alphaworks outlines how there's strong demand from unaccredited investors to back their favorite small businesses. However, the SEC is dragging their feet on approval of Title III that would allow this type of funding over the internet. I'm a big proponent of this and am eagerly waiting for legislation to pass

* **<a href = "http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2014/12/13/fitness-apps-wearables-can-impact-performance-work/" target="_blank">How Wearables Could Impact Your Work</a>**. I personally wear a Fitbit Flex, have had it for almost a year and am not one of the folks who have churned off. It helps me stay active and monitor my daily routines. I highly recommend getting a tracker that fits your need (they go for $99 now). I personally use it to make sure I'm taking intermittent walks even on days I cannot get to the gym, sleep enough, etc. My mood, productivity, and outlook really are boosted from the endorphins

* **<a href = "http://a16z.com/2014/12/17/a16z-podcast-enough-with-the-old-stuff-time-for-new-questions-in-mobile/" target="_blank">a16z Podcast: Enough with the Old Stuff â€” Time for New Questions in Mobile</a>**.

* **<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_islsqquXAo " target="_blank">What OKCupid's Data Tells Us About Dating</a>**. Some pretty awesome analysis in an interview from OKCupid's Founder that reveals the biases and tendencies people unknowingly have when dating. Christian Rudder takes us through the entire gamut from gender, race through to sexuality. No longer do we need to generalize what men and women do, there's data to prove it

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.duetdisplay.com/" target="_blank">Duet Display</a>**.  WOW. I've been looking for something like this for a while. Duet takes any of your iDevices (running iOS 6.0+) and turns them into a second monitor, seamlessly for any of your Mac devices (running OS 10.9+). This is simple and stellar
* 
* **<a href = "http://create.hope.ly/" target="_blank">Hope.ly</a>**. Use Hope.ly to shorten links to benefit the Red Cross. Shortened links will show a red ribbon on the landing page to solicit voluntary donations

* **<a href = "http://zenlist.co/" target="_blank">Zenlist</a>**.  Going into the New Year, this might be appealing to some. Zenlist makes you focus by listing three things to accomplish each day. For some this might be very helpful and help to improve productivity

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitsbox/bitsbox-monthly-coding-projects-for-kids?ref=category" target="_blank">Bitsbox</a>**. This is awesome-- a subscription service that helps children learn to code. Every month, a box shows up with beautifully illustrated visuals and easy-to-follow directions helping a child to slowly learn how to program. The perceived quality of this makes me want to get one!

* **<a href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chat-sports/id819629553?mt=8" target="_blank">Chat Sports</a>**. I've been looking for a faster, sleeker alternative to Bleacher Report and this might be it. You can follow live scores, news across traditional and social channels as well as share sports "stuff" with friends all from one app
