Summary: My notes from How to Start a Startup's Lecture 7 presented by Kevin Hale focusing on making products users love.

I am starting out-of-order but have wanted to share my notes from the lectures for the last month. Excuse the paper/pictures-- future ones will be scanned. These are not a substitute for the actual presentation but what I found interesting and valuable to my toolkit. Without further ado...

**Goal:** Make Products Users Love

* Wufoo was profitable 9 months post launch

>My philosophy behind a lot of things that I teach in startups is, the best way to get to $1 billion is to focus on the values that help you get that first dollar to acquire that first user. If you get that right, everything else will take care of itself. It's a sort of faith thing.

* User & Customer Relationships :: Real Life Relationships
	* Mistake early-on is costly
	* Mistake later-on can be accepted as long as it's fixed
* Connect to the customer's emotion. They will want to get behind the product and business to see it flourish
* Build a construct and behavior. People will get conditioned to it and except that to stay constant -- <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">design heuristics</a>

### Is it A Quality Item?

**Atarimae Hinshitsu.** Taken for granted quality

**Miryokuteki Hinshitsu.** Enchanting quality
 
* Like a beautiful app, easy to use, the interface is fluid, intuitive, gets the job done efficiently
* Adding features expand the "Knowledge Gap" -- avoid "making users fat"
* People often try to build a brand personality to connect to users through humor or wit
* Wit is the best way to build personality
* If product interaction is weak then wit or humor will not help

* EVERYone works in customer service
	* Wufoo - one day a week
	* Half day (Friday) for meetings
* Remote work reduces time waste and drives productivity
	* **TIME MANAGEMENT -- DON'T WASTE ANYONE'S TIME**
* Driving team accountability
	* Profit sharing
		* Customer service played a role. Align beliefs and incentivize around it
* Global, public task list
	* Can see what got done / what didn't
	* Question / rethink WHY if things aren't getting done
