Summary: Ratings have been around even before Uber and Yelp took the concept and applied it to common, everyday uses. Increasingly, I feel that simple, everyday situations where value is transferred could benefit from a more micro-level rating system.

I've been trying to think through this concept for a while now. Ratings have been around even before Uber and Yelp took the concept of ratings applied it to common, everyday uses. There are a variety of ratings/ranking/scoring systems with focuses on various markets and use cases but the majority focus on macro or company-level/brand sentiment-- not as much on the micro. Increasingly, I feel that simple, everyday situations where value is transferred could benefit from a more micro-level rating system.

I really like the Uber system where both parties (driver and passenger) offer a simple 1-5 rating. While this type of single-variable rating is best suited for simple offerings, there are multi-dimensional rating systems that could also be employed for situations, by virtue of the product or service, require a greater depth of evaluation.

I think there are three key points to consider to structuring effective ratings for everyday interactions:

1. **Low-friction.** Like Uber and Airbnb, the rating should be done as close to the time that value was exchanged. I know various retailers offer sweepstakes for customers to take satisfaction surveys but the friction is still high. This could easily be done with 2-3 questions at the POS, embedded into the UX or with the advent of mobile purchasing, with a simple push message (albeit still subjected to some friction/annoyance to the user)

2. **Two-way.** Where Uber and Airbnb really win as a marketplace is making sure both sides of the equation are represented. Every exchange of value is apart of a bigger marketplace for a good or service, why should ratings just be for the cashier or bank teller? Both values bring value to the table and interact. This captures customer interactions both positive or negative that could result in perceived great or poor service

3. **Anonymity.** Preserve anonymity to prevent "hard feelings." Uber is private and I think this works great. As part of being human, we will not get along or enjoy every experience-- this is ok and will result in less favorable ratings/reviews from time-to-time. Making sure the system is anonymous makes sure that future interactions are not hindered over a single rating from the past given that the action of rating an individual or party will likely be a recurring function

Areas that could benefit from ratings (that still largely don't have it):

* Cashiers and retail staff across all product (clothing, electronics, autos)
* Food service professionals (waiters, baristas, bar tenders)
* Real estate and rentals (supers, brokers, agents, maintenance, management)
* Financial services professionals (planning & advise, branch banking, lending)
* Established travel and hospitality service providers (airline and rail professionals, hotel staff)
* Health and wellness professionals (doctors, nurses, trainers, pharmacists)

I am sure there are numerous other situations but these came to mind and alone present large use cases for the idea. There are numerous business opportunities related to this but the data alone could provide value. Insights could improve compensation, staffing decisions, marketing and branding initiatives and product management.
