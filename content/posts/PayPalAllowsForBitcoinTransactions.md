Summary: PayPal allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin should allow it to see more liquidity resulting in lower price volatility which should reinforce it's durability as a store of value and in turn increase its acceptance.

PayPal announced this morning that it has partnered with various Bitcoin wallet providers to allow merchants to accept Bitcoin as payment. As it stands, people can purchase Bitcoin but only a handful of outlets accept it as payment. With this new feature, merchants can easily accept it provided they use PayPal. This news comes after Braintree (a part of the PayPal family) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/paypal-braintree/" target="_blank">announced</a> it will be able to process Bitcoins on its mobile payment solution.

Today's news is just another step in the "coming of age" for Bitcoin. While the integration is minor and PayPal doesn't hold inventory of Bitcoin, it offers some further validation for the cryptocurrency.

## Validation
PayPal's support is quite meaningful (even if the feature is minor for the broader product) for Bitcoin's future given that it could help further reinforce the following points:
* **Bitcoin is Money.** In order for something to be considered as money, it requires it to possess: durability, portability, fungibility, scarcity, divisibility, and recognizability. I'm not going to dissect all these points but if a name like PayPal allows merchants to accept it, it's one step closer to accepting it as money.
* **Security/Fraud.** With a name like PayPal now supporting Bitcoin, it brings additional validation to the block chain (a ledger of validated transactions) which is at the heart of Bitcoin. More about blockchains <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain" target="_blank">here</a>.
* **Liquidity.** More participants involved with the currency helps improve liquidity. This, in my opinion is the most important impact of this announcement.

## Impact on Price
I caught <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/23/bitcoins-price-skyrockets-following-paypals-hug/" target="_blank">this</a> piece that claims that the broader support puts downward pressure on the value of the currency. It cites the fact that people can more broadly spend the currency as the reason for the pressure. 

For one, I think it's silly to speculate on Bitcoin prices because it's what it sounds like-- a pure gamble. It's insanely volatile where 10% swings could make for a quiet day. What's more important to consider is the broader implication of the announcement-- prices trending closer to equilibrium. I agree that the "exit points" or spending points for Bitcoin are greater now but that just means Bitcoin could change hands similar to how the dollar does. The simplistic view that it should drop in value because you can spend it fails to account for the other side of the equation (buyers or merchants). 

PayPal's ability to accept Bitcoin payments introduces increased liquidity for those involved in cryptocurrency. I believe that the broader acceptance of Bitcoin will bring both buyers (people who want to accept Bitcoin) and sellers (people who want to sell Bitcoin) to the table and push it's value closer to equilibrium. Since uses for Bitcoin have been so limited and the mining process so intense, liquidity thus far has been constrained compared to other currencies (as measured by the spread between bid/ask prices). This lack of liquidity also contributes to price volatility where small volumes can greatly influence the overall value of the market.

I think of this as a circular reference-- Bitcoin sees more liquidity resulting in lower price volatility which should reinforce it's durability as a store of value and in turn increase its acceptance. I'm sure the Bitcoin market will see some in depth studies in the coming years due to it's complexity but this is just my high level perspective. Happy to hear everyone else's thoughts.
