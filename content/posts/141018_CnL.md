Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Why not get a head start on those weekend reads? I can also focus on cleaning up some of my notes from Start Up School in order to publish them tomorrow for anyone interested. After giving Pelican a try for a few months with this bland theme, I think it's time to make some design changes. Likely a project for the holidays.

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status= http://goo.gl/0kFSdU" target="_blank">share</a> this with your family and friends.

Ben Evans analyzes the idea of a "winner-takes-all dynamic" as the #2 mobile ecosystem (iOS) grows to 500M+ users with high engagement and app-spending levels. Good read for those interested in the iOS vs Android debate. 

* **<a href = "http://startupnotes.org/" target="_blank"> Startup School Notes</a>**. A great compilation of notes, taken in a succinct, visual manner from Startup School 2012 through 2014. For those who enjoyed the Paul Graham piece a couple weeks ago, this might be something of interest.

* **<a href = "http://blog.producthunt.com/post/100040456354/what-makes-a-great-investor-10-great-investors-weigh" target="_blank">What Makes a Great Investor</a>**? A list of responses from ten VC investors on the skills and qualities that they think "great investors" possess

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.transcense.com/" target="_blank">Transcense</a>**. This app allows people to easily converse with the deaf or hard-of-hearing without sign language. It's currently seeking financial support via Indiegogo-- has a little under a month left

* **<a href = "http://www.smartmat.com/" target="_blank">SmartMat </a>**. Timely given I am restarting my yoga practice after about 18 months. Using sensors in your mat, SmartMat links to a phone or tablet to monitor posture and form. Pretty cool but with an Indiegogo campaign at $259, it might be a bit too expensive for the consumer

* **<a href = "http://eatyourgreensapp.com/" target="_blank">Eat Your Greens</a>**. This app lets you take a pic of your meal and based on the colors recognized, it will help determine if you're getting the necessary nutrients. Cool idea, still trying to figure out if it's reliable/works

* **<a href = "http://www.getbond.co/" target="_blank">Bond</a>**. This is a great app that makes sure you stay in touch with your friends and loved ones. In our daily rush, we often forget to check-in on those close to us who might not live close to us. I am an offender at times but Bond could help

* **<a href = "http://www.key-disk.com/" target="_blank">KeyDisk</a>**. I'm not sure how I feel about this but I do know I hate keg rings. They are a pain (literally) to use. While there are limits to this design, it's nice to see a fresh take at something we use daily
