Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

I hope everyone is enjoying their holidays and had a relaxing, fun-filled Christmas Day (for those who observe) with loved ones. I for one appreciated the time to recharge and catch up on a laundry-list of things. I'm headed back North early tomorrow so I figured it made sense to get this out a day early. I wish everyone a very Happy New Year!

As a note, starting this week, I've joined the Amazon affiliate program and any products I find that are also available via Amazon will be listed below using my link. My hope is that this offsets the expense related to running the blog.

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please share this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://avc.com/2014/12/finding-roi-in-higher-education/" target="_blank">Finding the ROI in Higher Ed</a>**. College is expensive and the trend is not abating, every year, tuitions increase, student loan balances bloat and the job market remains challenged (don't look at the unemployment rate, look at the <a href="http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000" target="_blank">labor force participation rate</a>). Fred Wilson discusses the rise of other educational institutions and crunches the numbers of attending the development-focused, Flatiron School. Interesting read 

* **<a href = "http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/12/23/silicon-valley-looks-for-billion-dollar-ideas-in-india/?mg=blogs-wsj&url=http%253A%252F%252Fblogs.wsj.com%252Findiarealtime%252F2014%252F12%252F23%252Fsilicon-valley-looks-for-billion-dollar-ideas-in-india" target="_blank">Looking or India's Tech Elephant</a>**. The tech sector has long used India as an offshoring hub full of consultants, BPO specialists, and third-party talent. Now, Silicon Valley is setting its sights to find the first elephant from the startup boom. Will it be consumer-focused like Israeli-backed Waze? Or will it be more enterprise focused? Who's to say but the hunt is on

* **<a href = "https://gigaom.com/2014/12/24/facebook-opens-new-front-in-video-battle-with-youtube-and-twitter/" target="_blank">Facebook vs YouTube</a>**. News this week is that Facebook is bulking up its video offerings to take on YouTube head-on with original content. I'm sure many of you have seen the incredibly popular YouTube channels that have "everyday folks" netting tens to hundreds-of-thousands for a variety of video content ranging from music videos to amateur Madden clips. FB enters the game by courting both the NFL and Verizon to show ads after video clips-- end result could be a formidable competitor for YouTube if the platform is able to bring the high-quality content found on YouTube

* **<a href = "http://www.techradar.com/us/news/world-of-tech/how-machine-learning-and-image-recognition-could-revolutionise-search-1277547" target="_blank">Revolutionizing Search with Machine Learning & Image Recognition</a>**. A relatively short piece on the future of image search using machine learning. This has been an area I've been interested in over the years where computers can recognize parts of photos with little to no human interaction. Pretty cool stuff, after all, a picture's worth a 1,000 words

* **<a href = "http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/12/hardware-start-ups-now-look-a-lot-like-software-start-ups.html" target="_blank">The New Look of Hardware Startups</a>**. A free report from O'Reilly about how hardware and software are increasingly being blended together to build tomorrow's products and form tomorrow's businesses. The rise of IoT and connected devices will increasingly see these two competencies come together to deliver best-of-breed products

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pinc-vr-a-virtual-world-in-your-pocket" target="_blank">Pinć VR</a>**. An Oculus and Google Cardboard competitor, Pinć VR helps leverage your smartphone for virtual reality (the VR). Pinć VR stands out from the competitors with it's touch sensors that allow one to navigate the VR world-- depending on the price range they want to target (seems like $100-$150), it could be worth monitoring

* **<a href = "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G1PNG54/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00G1PNG54&linkCode=as2&tag=dynathouforan-20&linkId=DSIJ3PZB67WTLOCL" target="_blank">Rasberry Pi B+</a>**. So I got a nice chunk of change in Amazon cards and bought this bad boy for myself. It is a barebones PC running Linux but in a small form factor where one can quickly build other devices such as robots, toys, media centers, servers etc. Paired with <a href = "http://amzn.to/1xkIkPW" target="_blank">this LCD display</a>, I hope to make an internet-connected picture frame

* **<a href = "http://amzn.to/1vws631" target="_blank">Hubsan X4 (H107C) Quad Copter with Camera </a>**. I also got myself a starter drone that literally took me hours to select. I did my research and it seems safe to say that an inexpensive model is a better option before a DJI Phantom. Excited to get this flying around

* **<a href = "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/projects/workouts/" target="_blank">Seven Minute Workout from NYT</a>**. I for one need to hit the gym more and get back into shape in the New Year. Here's a quick workout from the NYT that one can do even on the busiest days  

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/torquing/zano-autonomous-intelligent-swarming-nano-drone?ref=category" target="_blank">ZANO</a>**. Currently funding on Kickstarter, the ZANO is a mini drone one can use for HD photo and video capture. Using a smart device and Wi-Fi, it can stream media in real-time. Something I'm considering backing-- price tag remains hefty, though ($200+)
