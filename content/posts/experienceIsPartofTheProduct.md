Summary: My run-in at the local bagel shop revealed some common customer/user experience mistakes that can doom your product. Customer experience isn't separate from the core product but one-and-the-same.

I decided to have an early lunch with a friend today and we agreed to run over to the nearby bagel shop for a bite. Without naming names, this place is renowned for their bagels-- literally the best I've had in NYC so far.

Despite having an amazing offering (bagels), I seldom go there because of the painful ordering, payment, and fulfillment experience. I've seen some people walk-in only to walk-out before ordering. Others simply steer clear because of "chaotic" experiences in the past. 

*The experience is so bad they are missing out on a large number of sales each day across a couple locations.*

While digital products are different from food services businesses, the major flaw is that *management thinks that a great product is separate from the experience around it*. So what are common causes of customer experience-related weaknesses:

* **Culture is everything.** Hand-in-hand with training your staff, weave a healthy culture into the day-to-day operations. There is a trickle-down effect as it relates to culture which starts from the top

* **Train your staff.** The staff at the bagel shop is awful. They don't know what's available, nor do they listen and absorb the customer's order. This isn't how you want your team to be, make sure they're responsive, engaged, and in-the-know. If they aren't perhaps you need some training or reevaluate management and cultural decisions

* **Be clear about what you offer.** Make sure users know what they can and cannot expect to get. Don't be vague or hide offerings in a series of cascading menus, be upfront and bold

* **Simple is wonderful.** Do just a few things very well. Don't overextend and try to do several things at once. Odds are each of those things will be mediocre at best. When it comes down to process, user flows, and customer services, keep it efficient-- minimal wait times and high responsiveness

Even if one has a great product offering, customers will get turned off by the poor experiences related to it. Capture the full opportunity at hand by understanding that product and experience aren't separate things but one-and-the-same.
