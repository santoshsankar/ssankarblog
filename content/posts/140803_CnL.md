Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Enjoy this week's edition of Coffee & Links with an extra link (see below). One thing I'm going to try to start doing is tracking data around interesting products that I crowdfund. I enjoy data and associated visualizations so I'm sure something interesting should come of the effort. For those who missed it, <a href ="goo.gl/0pXNRw" target = "_blank">here</a> is yesterday's post on my approach to supporting interesting products and ideas. On that note, have a great weekend and a share would be much appreciated. Enjoy!

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://simnett.net/post/93468162826/facebook-once-users-go-mobile-they-stay-mobile" target ="_blank"> Looking at Facebooks's Data - Stickiness of Mobile </a>**. Includes some great visuals on FB's usage patterns. I think this is relevant to anyone interested in seeing the shift from PC to mobile. FB is increasingly being accessed by mobile-only users. Part of the shift likely has to do with the nature of the product (communication, time-wasting, etc) is unknown but the trend has occurred for sometime.

* **<a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/27/the-return-of-the-desktop-productivity-app/?ncid=rss" target= "_blank">Desktop Productivity Apps Returning to the Native OS</a>**. I thought this was one of the more interesting things I read during the week. It outlines how certain apps shifted off the desktop, to the cloud (browser) then to the mobile device, only to return back to the desktop. There are a number of reasons for this shift but take a read for yourself. Likely something you have noticed over the years-- loops back to my piece on the <a href="goo.gl/qLkTvh" target="_blank">Relevance of Everyday Observations</a>.

* **<a href = "https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-07-20-opinion-who-needs-learning-relationship-management-we-all-do" target="_blank">Learning Relationship Management</a>**. Education has long been an interesting space for investors due to its market size, importance and opportunities. I think this is a great piece that shows how a relationship management system of sorts could be built to help ensure that students have the community and support system they need for development. I will not divulge the details of the idea but definitely worth a read.

* **<a href = "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/what-is-pinterest-a-database-of-intentions/375365/" target="_blank"> Pinterest -- A Repository of Intentions</a>**. Pinterest, like Facebook and Twitter, has a lot of data and could be thought of as a database of intent. That is, a visual list of things people plan or are interested in buying, experiencing, tasting, wearing, making, etc. But what does Pinterest think? Well here is a quick quote- "So we think of Pinterest some days as this crazy human indexing machine." The Atlantic interviews co-founder Evan Sharp about what he thinks Pinterest is, the current state of the company, plans for the future and monetization opportunities. Likely something of interest to most people, especially Pinterest users.
 
* **<a href = "http://recode.net/2014/07/29/the-internet-of-things-is-the-hackers-new-playground/?" target="_blank">IoT = Security Threat</a>**. To start, I don't think this is new news or a unique insight. More so, I think it does well to highlight the risks, where they exist and why they exist. I think it's important for everyone to think about security and their approach to it as they equip homes, appliances, vehicles, etc with connectivity. While it might seem trivial or even farfetched, there is plenty of malaise out there and the IoT just brings more opportunities for security breaches. One could even boil it down to law of large numbers, more nodes = more technology-related crime and abuse.

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/mattermark-daily/mattermark-has-raised-2m-in-our-second-seed-round-e93b20dc59b0" target="_blank"> Mattermark's Danielle Morrill's Post-Funding Journal</a>**.  I should've shared this long ago, so I'm taking the time to do it now. I've long admired Mattermark for it's use of data in an under-tapped market (hey, I work in equity research). I also enjoy the tidbits co-founder, Danielle Morrill <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielleMorrill" target="_blank">shares</a> about Mattermark's findings and her experiences as a founder. Enjoy this summation of Mattermark's latest angel round and the progress the company has made thus far. For those of you who don't already know, <a href="https://mattermark.com/app/Newsletter" target ="_blank">the daily email</a> of "must reads" is a "must have".

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/monolyth-control-your-ac-unit-with-a-smartphone" target="_blank">Monolyth</a>**. I funded this idea. I think this is a great way to bring "smarts" to existing, antiquated AC units. Living in NYC, there is no central air, it's all window-installed. I come home frequently to wish I had could control the temperature from work- nothing worse than a muggy room after 15 hours of work. It would also be nice to have a remote control to calibrate the temperature once I hit the bed or sit at my desk. The market is quite large given the concentration of populations in urban areas, the install base of window-based AC units and a price point that could be justified as an "investment" provided the energy savings are substantial (which they should be). Looking forward, it would be cool to see this technology applied to different appliances too- washers, dryers, fridge, etc.

* **<a href = "https://www.kitchensurfing.com/" target="_blank">Kitchensurfing</a>**. This is an awesome, at-home chef service. The whole point is to bring the ease of restaurant service into the home. It's available in many cities with chefs well versed in a variety of cuisines and cooking methods like African and BBQ, respectively. I have yet to try it but it seems like it could do well within a certain demographic of individuals.- those who entertain a lot but are unable to prepare food effectively / efficiently. For the chefs, it brings valuable experience that could help them establish their name in a difficult and competitive profession. For those of you who know me personally, I love food and there seems to be a few things better than eating up, learning how to make a new dish and learning about a culture while making a new friend. I will try to find an appropriate time in the near-future to arrange a Kitchensurfing experience and revert.

* **<a href = "https://www.aglocal.com/" target="_blank">AgLocal</a>**. Another food-related offering. I think that there are some great things being done in the food and beverage space with much more to come. AgLocal allows customers to order pasture-raised meat every month from local farms. I have many friends who make an effort to source their meat from local organic venues that are committed to ethical treatment of animals. While AgLocal currently only delivers to the Western US, I am interested to see how they scale and supercharge the profit potential for local and regional farms. Bringing efficient and reliable distribution to sub scale farms in remote regions could change the economics of agriculture.

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1679699735/vocca-turn-any-simple-light-bulb-into-a-voice-acti" target="_blank">Vocca</a>**. I did not fund this idea but I am considering it. Similar to Monolyth, I think it's great that something unchanged for year, the lightbulb fixture is being given an upgrade. Essentially one screws in the Vocca into a socket, installs a bulb into Vocca and can control their light with voice. It's not economical for homeowners to rewire their old lighting with a "smart" capability. Instead, they can retrofit it with something like Vocca and gain a similar level of convenience that today's modern smart home systems offer. Also, the current offerings on the market are disposable, as in, you pay the $90 and in a few years time, you throw the bulb out -- instead, Vocca is permanent (until it breaks or is out innovated).I'll be following Vocca closely and will update everyone if I do fund it (I just do not have a ton of bulbs in my apartment).

* **<a href = "http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/07/introducing-the-internet-org-app/" target="_blank">Internet.org App</a>**. While we cannot use this in the US, I thought it was interesting and important to share since it's Internet.org's first app. It launches in Zambia first and allows users to access a variety of internet services without the burden of data fees. Facebook, Google, Wikipedia and Facebook messenger are among the apps included.
