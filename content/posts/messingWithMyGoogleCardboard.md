Summary: Since Facebook snapped up Oculus VR, I have been mulling the future of virtual reality. I recently got my Google Cardboard and after playing with it, I too agree that virtual reality can be a platform.

I got my <a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/" target="_blank">Google Cardboard</a> last week in the mail from <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/products/google-cardboard-vr-goggle-toolkit" target="_blank">DoDoCase</a> and have spent time after work and on the weekend playing around with it. I was a skeptic of virtual reality earlier when Oculus VR was snapped up by Facebook for $2bn. I didn't think virtual reality could be a platform and instead would lose significance to augmented reality. **Boy was I wrong.** 

The change in sentiment did not happen overnight. I mulled it over for a couple months. I had two big turn offs initially, 1) the cost and 2) form factor. These were solvable in the medium-term but then I began to question relevant use cases. I think I'm finally convinced that uses go beyond just content consumption.

Seeing and using Google Cardboard which is a lower cost and has a smaller (but not a more attractive) form factor helped make it "click." Assuming the cost, durability and simplicity of Cardboard prevails, here are some potential use cases:

* **Military & Law Enforcement.** This is already happening. Specifically, <a href ="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/7512/20140527/darpa-uses-oculus-rift-technology-to-prep-military-for-cyber-warfare.htm" target="_blank">DARPA is using Oculus VR</a> (hey they have deep pockets) to help soldiers "get into the Internet" in an effort to prep for cyberwarfare. Separately, Norwegian forces have hacked together a solution to <a href ="http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/5/5682942/the-norwegian-army-is-using-the-oculus-rift-to-drive-tanks" target="_blank">help soldiers drive tanks easily</a>. However, I consider this more to be augmented reality given it is being used in real time to augment and ease the process of maneuvering a tank-- an opportunity for Google Glass?

* **Content.** Obvious point that spans video games, sports, TV and movies. I think that the use could be for live (but viewed remotely, like in a living room) or replay, the latter potentially being easier for richer interactions. Imagine being able to pull up a Steelers game and being placed in optimal viewpoints to enjoy top plays. Or better yet, how cool would it be to sit inside a TV show, like a ghost and see Sheldon and Wolowitz throw jabs at each other.

    The monetization can obviously occur with ads but I think this opens up a new layer of content offerings. Perhaps walk throughs and "second-screen" type commentary and additions. 

* **Sports Training.** Tangentially related to my previous example, this could be huge in collegiate and professional sports. Instead of watching video, players could observe successes, mistakes and missteps in a more detailed third person or first person format. Teams are using GoPros now to gain a first person perspective.

    Monetization likely occurs with add-on offerings from sports data and analytics providers. Perhaps data points related to speed, pitch, angle, etc (think sabermetrics). Any value-add beyond just observations could help with monetization efforts.

* **Education.**  Google is gaining ground in the classroom and Cardboard, specifically could be a great fit. Imagine being able to go on a "field trip" more than 3-4x a year. How about once a week? Tour the Louvre or see the marine life of the Great Barrier Reef. It helps to minimize the impact of location and income plays into school trips. It could even benefit those students with physical disabilities that might limit them from having immersive experiences. 

    I took a Mediterranean Archeology and Literature class in college that was taught by a husband and wife who travel the region every year working on-site. They had great stories, pictures and findings but it would have 2x as awesome if they could have recreated the excavation site.

    Given it's cost, Cardboard can be replaced without (much) hassle if it gets worn out. Low cost Droids, the brains of the product are also inexpensive enough to make maintenance and replacement less of an issue. With Classroom and Chrome OS efforts, the Google ecosystem is becoming more prevalent in education.

    Monetization, at a high level seems to be more straight forward. It includes apps, services and education-focused analytics. Overall, for developers looking for ideas, I feel like this opportunity could be (relatively) low-hanging fruit.

* **Engineering & Design.** As it stands, engineers use CAD to render buildings, interiors, products, etc prior to production. It would be quite cool if one could don a VR headset and be able to explore their home-to-be or see interior design changes. Perhaps engineers could even look at structural details aided by VR. I am not sure the benefits of seeing something in the first person perspective but can't discount it.

These are just a few ways I think VR could come of age as a platform across a variety of uses. My previous perception was wrong and I do think that VR and augmented reality could co-exist and generate value for us all. For those interested, try out Google Cardboard from <a href="http://www.dodocase.com/products/google-cardboard-vr-goggle-toolkit" target="_blank">DoDoCase</a>. There are a variety of cool apps popping up and maybe you could gain the inspiration to embark on building your own app.

A quick note, I have found multiple sources that claim that Cardboard also works with iPhone, just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=google+cardboard+for+iphone&oq=google+cardboard+for+i&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.3216j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Google</a> it.
