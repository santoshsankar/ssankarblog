Summary: Obligatory Hello World on Digital Ocean Servers

Well, as is normal with learning new languages (here I am learning how to configure a VPS)-- Hello World!

I am proud to say we are hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=4326c62c8117) running [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/). Over the next few weeks I will transition all my old posts over but expect fresh, new content to start ASAP!
