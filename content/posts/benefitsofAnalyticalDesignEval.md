Summary: As I progress through my design course, I have taken to analytical design evaluation which I believe everyone can benefit from, forming a design-centric way to help them innovate.

My design class has really changed the way I view the products- digital and physical that I use daily. Similar to how my finance background got me questioning the economics, margins and the growth potential of things around me, it's like a switch in my head flipped and I am starting to feel more empathy for the challenges designers tackle in the design/development process.

With my limited design experience, I consider design as a way of either creatively solving recurring and/or novel problems or evolving beyond the status quo. While I am like every other person, appreciating beautiful UIs and salivating over slick elements, I understand that design goes far beyond that. I am more critical of **the purpose and effectiveness** of all components- panes, screens, text, links, buttons, flow, etc. I think about elements and design in a similar way to how I steer my conversations and develop relationships-- direct and with meaning. No beating around the bush or wasting time... getting right to the point.

# How Design Evaluation Impacts Me

This analytic evaluation is helping me to refine how I think about which apps are great and which are good. The great ones directly address user problems, helping them effectively and efficiently meet their goals. The good ones might be overextended, have a complex or unclear process/flow, lack the little details or have a rough UX around basic but important elements (ex: social sharing, saving credentials, saving typed content, easy to navigate menu, etc). At the end of the day, products, whether they are apps or not, are made to solve certain problems in the most efficient, effective and intuitive way.

Critical evaluation also stokes my innovative juices-- coming up with small tweaks, a running list of hacks or full blown ideas. It allows me to observe what's working and what's not working and incorporate it or adjust my side project as necessary. I also find myself able to discuss businesses and business models more effectively given that my understanding at the product level is growing and able to complement by finance and business acumen.

# How Design Evaluation Could Impact Others

Anyone can benefit from this type of design evaluation with path to entrepreneurship likely being the most attractive benefit. It could set up even the most unlikely individual to be a founder by helping them solve a problem better than the status quo or addressing a common issue with a unique solution and large market opportunity. After all, the best and most successful ideas are found in the most unlikely places, solving problems that the founder and team have experienced and are able to creatively and passionately to solve.It's a well-thought out, design-centric way to help *anyone to innovate.*
