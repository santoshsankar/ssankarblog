## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://time.com/facebook-world-plan/" target="_blank">The Facebook World Plan</a>**. Zuck outlines his vision/plan for the next decade and how specific projects are working towards executing on that vision. In an effort to get everyone online, Facebook spearheaded Internet.org where now they are starting to retool experience and see the web as the majority does (slow connections on dated devices)-- talk about building empathy for your users... solid read

* **<a href = "http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-11-20/mobile-payment-startup-venmo-is-killing-cash" target="_blank">Venmo is Killing Cash</a>**. For those of you who don't use Venmo, *read this profile*. Venmo is an easy to use and secure way to instantly transfer funds that combines the features of personal finance and social media. Interesting stat- payments are up almost 400% y/y in Q3 2014. I use it weekly to settle bills, tabs and other P2P debts-- highly recommend it

* **<a href = "http://www.paulgraham.com/mean.html" target="_blank">Mean People Fail by Paul Graham</a>**. Graham succinctly lays out why mean folks will not succeed in the long-run. *Just be nice*

* **<a href = "http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html" target="_blank">Trends in Chinese Mobile App UI</a>**. Pretty cool piece that outlines the trends in user interfaces found in popular Chinese apps. It's cool to see how cultural and behavioral tendencies might impact the development of UI across different regions

* **<a href = "http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2014/12/04/neas-peter-barris-on-why-venture-capital-has-a-great-decade-ahead/" target="_blank">Why VC Has A Great Decade Ahead</a>**. NEA's Peter Barris did an interview at Startup Grind in DC and laid out his thinking in regards to the future of VC. The one statement that I really loved and for those who know me, have heard me take a similar view- "Today’s stock market doesn’t matter because we’re investing for where the stock market is five to seven years from now not where it is today."

* **<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHBbBVLBFAI" target="_blank">Interview with AgLocal Founder, Naithan Jones</a>**. I have been fascinated with food startups and this interview of Naithan Jones, founder of AgLocal is awesome. He discusses his background, supporting local, organic farmers, and the details the AgLocal business model

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.getpennies.com/" target="_blank">Pennies</a>**. A seemingly simple app to help track daily purchases. The thing I like about this app is that it requires one to physically input purchases. While passive solutions are great, the realization of spending is quite a powerful way to curb nonsensical spending

* **<a href = "http://couponfollow.com/checkout" target="_blank">Coupons at Checkout</a>**. This Chrome Extension helps you find coupons while you online shop. During the checkout process, it will alert you and provide relevant coupon codes to help save money

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tzoa/meet-tzoa-the-worlds-first-enviro-tracker" target="_blank">Tzoa</a>**. A pretty cool Kickstarter project that helps one monitor their surroundings as they go about their daily routine. v1 offers air pollution and UV readings as well as solutions to improve one's environment if indoors (ex: open a window, turn off a fan, etc). Pretty cool application of wearables and IoT-- crowdsourced environmental data

* **<a href = "http://feltapp.com/" target="_blank">Felt</a>**. An iOS app that allows one to turn up to five of their photos into "story frames" with borders and text. The result is printed and mailed on high quality paper. Felt also has regular cards that can be customized and sent to print using an iPad

* **<a href = "http://www.ellusionist.com/pyro-handheld-fireshooter-by-adam-wilber.html" target="_blank">PYRO Fireshooter</a>**. Shoot fireballs from the palm of your hand using PYRO... one step closer to being the Human Torch
