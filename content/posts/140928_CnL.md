## Coffee & Links

Wesley Chan and David Hirsch emailed their founders and friends to voice their opinions on startup cash burn. Read their emails-- some good foresight into the future of the VC funding markets.

* **<a href = "http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2014/09/25/beauty-of-testing/" target="_blank">The Beauty of Testing</a>**. Steven Sinofsky explains the importance of testing in the software development process. He frames it's relevance by highlighting the checks/balances a tester provides to a software team. Long read but one that will bring you into the inner processes what it takes to build a great app.

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@hemeon/the-making-of-tiiny-60b527757997" target="_blank"> The Making of Tiiny</a>**. The first app out of Kevin Rose's North focuses on redesigning the photo sharing experience. I like reading about the process it takes to build a product. For those who have ideas and want to "make an app," understand the work that goes into it.

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/storytelling-duarte/" target="_blank">The Art of Story Telling</a>**. Tunguz reviews the storytelling skills he learned from Nancy Duarte's book, <a href = "http://www.duarte.com/book/resonate/" target="_blank">Resonate</a>. I think I might add this to my reading list but for those looking for a summary or a quick way to augment their existing know-how, go no further.

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/go-build-something/patience-grasshopper-9e34a5c9def4" target="_blank">Startups Require Patience</a>**. A simple, succinct list of areas founding teams tend to push too hard on and rush when they embark on expanding their business. While these might seem obvious, it's worth reviewing given that few people can pause to think through hiring, capital and relationship decisions while things are going at 1,000 mph.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiiny-share-tiny-photos-looping/id915963345?mt=8" target="_blank">Tiiny</a>**. Being an Android user, I downloaded this to my iPad. I have to say, it's pretty cool. I enjoy the small grid of pictures, the live camera up top and the "fresh" experience. That being said, not sure it will be adopted en mass, might be TOO different for the casual user. On that note, download and judge for yourself.

* **<a href = "http://us.kano.me/" target="_blank">Kano Kit</a>**. A hardware and open source software kit that will help people of all ages better understand technology. One can put the kit together and program a variety of things including simple games like Pong and Minecraft.

* **<a href = "http://beerapp.co/" target="_blank">Beer?!</a>**. Inspired by Yo. This simple app helps you ask your friends to grab a drink at the local watering hole.

* **<a href = "https://shiftpayments.com/" target="_blank">A Debit Card for Bitcoin</a>**. Shift is still in beta but I had the opportunity to order my card this weekend. Cards are pricey ($20) but allows one to use their Bitcoins like they would cash with a debit card.

* **<a href = "https://www.onradpad.com/paymyrent" target="_blank">RadPad</a>**. Many landlords still require you to write a rent check every month. RadPad is an app that allows one to use their debit or credit card to quickly pay their rent while the landlord still receives a check.
