## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/1/1/20-questions-for-2015" target="_blank">20 Questions for 2015</a>**. Ben Evans puts forth 20 questions he thinks will be answered as it relates to mobile devices, wearables and apps in 2015. Similarly, Fred Wilson took a crack at making some<a href = "http://avc.com/2015/01/what-is-going-to-happen/">predictions for 2015</a>. Both are must reads

* **<a href = "http://calacanis.com/2015/01/07/firing-dick-costolo-from-twitter-would-be-a-huge-mistake/" target="_blank">Jason Calacanis' Views on Twitter and it's Leadership</a>**. Excellent piece on leadership at Twitter and how the introduction of a video product can help drive value. I think this really hits the nail on the head

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@henrysward/broken-cap-tables-bbf84574a76a" target="_blank">Broken Cap Tables</a>**. A cap table is a document a Company, along with legal counsel maintains to enumerate investors, associated shares, and ownership. Henry Ward goes through the massive issue with incorrect cap tables, a lack of process to verify and update tables, and how employee equity holders ultimately suffer the most from a lack of process/system of record

* **<a href = "http://thisweekinmusictech.tumblr.com/post/106613895112/2015-predictions-will-spotify-get-in-the-label#_=_" target="_blank">2015 Predictions for Music Tech</a>**. A new pickup in my reading list, this post tosses around the idea of Spotify establishing a music label in 2015. A prediction but still interesting given Netflix, Amazon and Google have established means for attracting, creating and owning ideas for original video content. Check out another prediction related to <a href = "http://thisweekinmusictech.tumblr.com/post/105966485122" target="_blank">opening up</a> the massive platform that music businesses have established and give audiences more control of content, similar to Buzzfeed (in the realm of journalism)

* **<a href = "http://www.coindesk.com/state-bitcoin-2015-ecosystem-grows-despite-price-decline/" target="_blank">State of Bitcoin</a>**. A great Slideshare from Coindesk. 2014 was a volatile year for Bitcoin and the latest problems at Bitstamp likely haven't helped with price stability. Nonetheless, the future is still bright with ongoing investments aiding the build out of the Bitcoin platform

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.google.com/cast/audio/" target="_blank">Google Cast</a>**. Cast audio from any phone, tablet or laptop to Cast-enabled speakers. Cast uses the same technology Chromecast uses and is bringing some "intelligence" to otherwise "stupid" speaker boxes

* **<a href = "http://www.zutalabs.com/" target="_blank">ZUtA</a>**. Self-proclaimed to be the world's smallest, robotic printer, Zuta can print on any sized piece of paper. It's a pretty cool device-- check out the demo video

* **<a href = "http://barnotes.co/" target="_blank">BarNotes</a>**. A "social cocktail app," BarNotes helps mixologists, cocktail buffs, etc connect, share and discover recipes. I tried it out last night-- pretty cool

* **<a href = "https://vouch.com/" target="_blank">Vouch</a>**. Vouch is a full-fledged company- the focus here is on their trust-based lending product. The premise is that friends and family know a borrower best and getting several of them to "vouch" for one's creditworthiness could help better price a loan. The more "vouches" one gets, the lower the interest rate on the loan from Vouch

* **<a href = "http://lu.gg/" target="_blank">Lugg</a>**. An on-demand moving app that helps people with one-off requests to move stuff. While this joins an increasingly crowded moving space led by the likes of Bellhops and Moveline, Lugg seems to be focused on spontaneous or informal situations. For example, help getting furniture from Ikea to your house because it won't fit in your car or assistance in moving lumber from Home Depot to your backyard
