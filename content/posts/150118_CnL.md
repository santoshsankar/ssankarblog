Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth, and angel investing.

For me, a whirlwind week is coming to an end and the second week of setting my resolutions. While I'm doing well with some, I'm seriously struggling to get into a routine with others. Here's to firing on all cylinders this upcoming week. 
If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please share this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@rubenharris/breaking-into-startups-cc092432305a" target="_blank">Breaking Into Startups</a>**. This was sent to me via Facebook by a friend and has to be the best thing I read this week. Personally, it helped me confirm my approach to a career transition while giving me some pointers on outreach and level of pursuit

* **<a href = "http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/12/9/mobile-platforms-and-technical-debt" target="_blank">Mobile Platforms and Technical Debt</a>**. Ben Evans discusses the evolution of mobile devices and the tradeoffs major manufacturers have made over the years

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/gross-margin-cashflow-margin-trends-in-saas/" target="_blank">Are SaaS Startups As Profitable These Days</a>**? "Despite the decline in price points catalyzed by the consumerization of IT, startups are finding ways to develop efficient and profitable companies regardless"  

* **<a href = "http://torgronsund.com/2015/01/08/entrepreneurial-writing/" target="_blank">Why Every Entrepreneur Should Write</a>**. The title says it all. I think everyone should write, but this is a pretty persuasive piece that highlights the importance of writing for business leaders

* **<a href = "http://cdixon.org/2013/02/10/the-computing-deployment-phase/" target="_blank">The Computing Deployment Phase</a>**. This is an oldie but it surfaced in my reading and wow-- wish I knew about Carlota Perez's book earlier. It discusses the nature of technological revolutions. I've added it to my laundry list of must-reads

* **<a href = "http://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html" target="_blank">Communicating with Corporate Dev as a Founder</a>**. Being an ex-banker, I found this to be interesting. I agree with most of Graham's perspectives on communication with a large company's M&A team. I would probably note that there is some value, once there is cadence in your business to entertain short discussions with corp dev folks. Corp dev folks talk to a lot of people and can be a good source of information and network building. However, like Paul says, in the early innings, it's important to keep building before worrying about this stuff 

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://pinrose.com/" target="_blank">Pinrose</a>**. The best description I've seen is "the Warby Parker of perfumes"

* **<a href = "https://laterbox.co/" target="_blank">Laterbox</a>**. This is a pretty cool idea although, I feel like there are numerous products where one can jot down an idea and revisit it. I use Google Keep but this might be more useful for others

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ampstrip-comfortable-24-7-heart-rate-wearable" target="_blank">AmpStrip</a>**. I am big into health and fitness and it seems that no one has yet hit the need for an accurate, easy to wear heart rate monitor. AmpStrip gives it a try with disposable strips (3-7 day life) that monitor one's heart rate. It's a bit pricey but I like the form factor of this first iteration

* **<a href = "http://5coins.cmsight.com/" target="_blank">5coins</a>**. Yet another expense tracking app with some beautiful design and great usability. Whether it sticks is the question

* **<a href = "http://twindr.me/" target="_blank">Twindr</a>**. A tinder-like interface for unfollowing those "dead-weight" people that appear on your Twitter
