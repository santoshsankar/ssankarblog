Summary: At the root of it all, a great community is to building businesses and entrepreneurship what a great tree is to building a treehouse. 

I spent the weekend exploring Chattanooga, TN this past weekend and had the opportunity to meet leaders in their startup scene. I was able to visit <a href="http://colab.co/" target="_blank">The Co.Lab</a>  located in what the locals refer to as the Southside where I met several talented leaders in the startup community.

Particularly I met the team behind The Treehouse Project which launched its <a href="http://www.sleepinatree.co" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign earlier this afternoon. For those looking to spend time outdoors and realize (or relive) their childhood fantasies of a treehouse-- this is a great way to do it.

As I was trying to learn more about the city and what it offers, we got into a great conversation on the merits of Chattanooga and it's emerging startup scene. As first-movers, teams like The Treehouse Project also take it upon themselves to develop the community. Some observations really stuck with me and validated my thinking regarding what could be a successful community. 

*At the root of it all, a great community is to building businesses and entreprenuership, what a great tree is to building a treehouse.* 

## Observations That Stuck

* **Public/Private Can Work.** For my followers, it is no surprise I love environments that opt for the pro-private route with the help of governmental authorities. While I had a limited view of this directly, I feel like Chattanooga should be an example or the rest of the United States. Governmental authorities do not erect unnecessary barriers or red tape but work to facilitate and advance the goals of private entities, which operate in an ethical and values-driven way.
	The business community maintains an image and follows through with the common belief that profits do not come at the expense of the environment, socioeconomic groups, et al. Everyone can prosper by working together.

* **Communities/Ecosystems are Essential Support Systems.** I have long held the view that in order to have a successful and thriving startup scene, there needs to be a 100% buy-in from the community. The support system a community can offer goes beyond connections and capital. Citizens will naturally be inclined to support and offer feedback on products and services they enjoy and rely on.

	A close-knit community that supports the concept of entrepreneurship and innovation will also result in increased cross pollination of ideas and talent, individuals willing to contribute time (and capital), and most importantly, an emotional network. Building a business is tough for those in their 20s and in their 40s, alike. There will naturally be moments when one just needs advice, mentorship or to decompress. What better way to clear one's head before a product roll-out or strategy session than hiking with a small group of friends?

* **Burning Out â‰  Working Hard.** The idea of making sure there's not a burnout culture came up. This resonated with me especially in light of the news that Reddit's CEO had stepped down due to burn out. Working hard and working smart should be valued and is not the same as slaving late into the night, waking up early just to do it again. I'm not saying these situations won't exist, building products and businesses is hard work but such routines should not be a benchmark everyone should strive for- it's not healthy.

	I feel like the talent and culture of Chattanooga, the sense of community, helps to prevent this. People are encouraged to think creatively, get outdoors and experience what the city has to offer. I feel like sometimes this lacks in other cities, while companies might do things differently and combat this, I believe this thinking should be deeply rooted into a startup ecosystem.

I can't stress how much I like Chattanooga and the community being developed there will surely be the basis for the successful "treehouses" of the future.
