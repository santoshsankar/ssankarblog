Summary: The "Life Feed" a contextually aware smart streams that surfaces and alerts of us important information related to our past. The feed would take into account where we grew up lived, went to school, family and friends, work and career as well as our interests.

Today I was scanning Facebook where I saw that someone's mom had posted news around a data breach at my alma mater, Penn State. The post was a link to <a href ="http://www.statecollege.com" target="_blank">State College.com</a>, while popular amongst locals, is not something most alumni would think of frequenting. How would I have known if not by chance or until the University contacted me? (Note: this only impacted a small subset of medical alumni) This got me thinking about how our past locales, experiences, connections, decisions, et al can impact us out-of-the-blue in the present. And like most things in the world, I think technology could help.

# My Rough Thoughts and Vision

The concept of monitoring is not new- credit bureaus, identity theft services, banks, insurers, government, etc all monitor something or the other on our behalf. But to my knowledge, there is not a single service that can monitor news flow, social media chatter, press releases, etc and surface things of relevance or interest-- all based on *context*. By context, I refer to the ability of the service or utility to understand us and deliver information based on . Perhaps an example would help--

## Example of my Vision

I would sign up for said service, the "Life Feed" and it would go about gathering information on me. Remember, the point of this is to alert me as the user if anything of relevance is floating around based on what the service knows about me. I would envision the tool to scrape my social media and other online profiles for information (and on-going updates). I could then fill in the remaining details and edit the data as I see fit. You would be surprised how much is out there already about us that we can use to our advantage.

The service could alert me through push notifications for urgent items-- which perhaps I can set as a user. Other things could be delivered via a weekly email digest on what (if any) important things have happened related to people, places or things that I have connections and relations to. 

You might think, weekly? But remember, these are related to you in the past, it is important enough to be connected but not so important as requiring real time updates. Anything that important would be delivered via a push message anyways. This configuration would also limit information overload which would make the service useless.

## Powered by Data

So maybe it makes sense to list out the types of data I was thinking the service would be privy to:

**Hometown.** After all, events where I grew up are important to know about. Connections to places and/or people that live there are important to be aware of. For example, perhaps an older neighbor passed-- sorry for the morbid example but this is not something easy to come by but with such a tool, it could be easily distilled and allow one to offer their condolences. Another example could be that a historical landmark or neighborhood fixture is under threat and needs support. How would you know if you are not living there or on top of the local press?

**Places we have lived.** Following the same concept as above, it is likely helpful to be aware of major events in past cities/towns one has lived at. Even if we do not live or exist on our previous locales, we likely have friends and memories there. I do believe that we take a piece of the places we live with us as we move on in life. From my freshman year in college (2007) till my second year out of school (2012), my family moved three times. Each time, especially when I was still in college, I took a piece Richmond and St. Louis a long with me. It is still important for me to stay on top of major events due to friends, colleagues (and for a certain period of time, assets) in the area.

**Where we were educated.** This is important and obviously stoked my thinking here. Education really shapes who we are from the K-12 through grad school. In America you see towns form around strong school districts. Traditions and whole communities then develop from institutions of higher learning. 

Let's not forget the extracurriculars we're all involved in too. Who wouldn't want to know if their high school team won State Football Championships? How about monitoring the club you founded in college? Maybe they are doing big things or are in need of sponsorship? These are all great things for a weekly digest of "FYIs."

Education in general leaves a lot of open, life-long connections one should and needs to stay on top of. In my case it was the potential theft of personal data but it could be anything from leadership changes at your college to your old baseball coach's state coaching honor.

**Family and friends.** This might seem a bit creepy but Facebook already has these connections. Why shouldn't a personal assistant like this be privy to such data? Details around where they live, what they do, where they work, spouses, children, etc can also be helpful in our hypothetical "Life Feed."

**Work and Career.** So we have our personal life covered but work and career is important too. We might change companies, industries or roles but we still have connections to those experiences. You do not need constant updates but something like a merger or massive share price gains could help in the context of old stock compensation. Other items might include management changes or large changes in the market landscape-- more "FYIs."

**General interests.** To round this all out, it would help to know our interests. This is easy to pull and monitor from Facebook posts, Tweets, Google+, Pins, Feedly, Pocket saves, and other information trails of the like. It further places the aforementioned into context. To illustrate, the Life Feed wouldn't ping me on everything Penn State but know that I would like to hear about the business school's major proceedings. It would know that I am not as interested about tennis as I am football so tailor itself accordingly. 

The point is to know about us then drill deeper, dig further to know what is important and what is not. As the service is used, the algorithm would presumably improve thereby improving our experience.

## Privacy

To be blunt, this would be a personal tool. No one sees it but the user (and maybe other one permissions). It would not really add more data as much as use existing data to help augment and monitor events as it relates to the past. The foundational data science, machine learning, social networking and other technologies exist. Now it's just a matter of properly designing and developing this idea.

After a few hours of contemplating this, here are my thoughts. Would be awesome to hear what others think. I think this is still very raw.

On a side note, please help me out with my user research for an idea related to the travel industry-- survey is <a href="http://goo.gl/nCAGYw" target="_blank">here</a>. It takes 5-8 minutes and you could win an Amazon gift card!
