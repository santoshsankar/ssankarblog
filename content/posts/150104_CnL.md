Happy New Year! I hope everyone is enjoying their last weekend of the holidays. Unfortunately, I've been battling something nasty for the past couple days and continue to be under the weather. As such, please excuse the lack of a product roundup. Enjoy the first round up of 2015 and if you do find an interesting article or product on here, please share this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://www.paulgraham.com/95.html" target="_blank">Let the Other 95% of Programmers In</a>**. A stellar piece supporting the urgent need for immigration reform. Graham backs up his belief with data and anecdotal evidence. He isn't saying to open the borders for anyone/everyone but highlighting the needs (and benefits) of allowing talented individuals (the majority who are overseas) to come and work in the US without impediment 

* **<a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/26/business/mba-programs-start-to-follow-silicon-valley-into-the-data-age.html?_r=0" target="_blank">MBA Programs Start to Follow Silicon Valley Into the Data Age</a>**. Interesting to see how MBA programs are shifting their curriculum and approach as workplace skills change. A more balanced focus on technology-based skills and know-how as well as much as the business and strategy. I didn't realize till reading this that the Cornell Tech program is also only one-year and approximately $93,000 (75% of candidates have STEM undergrad degrees)

* **<a href = "http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/how-to/technology/2014/12/coding-class-changes-outlook-on-technology.html" target="_blank">How a 9-hour Coding Class Changed My Outlook On Technology</a>**. My buddy Adam shared this with me a few weeks ago (apologies for the late share). But man, this is a fantastic piece that really supports my obsession around how we must all gain foundational skills in computer science which can be applied elsewhere in life. Give it a read, you won't be disappointed

* **<a href = "http://avc.com/2014/12/some-thoughts-on-founder-liquidity/" target="_blank">Thoughts on Founder Liquidity</a>**. There's been a lot of chatter with the recent WSJ piece around founder liquidity. Basically, this is when founders sell down a chunk of their ownership to outside investors for cash. While there are several thoughts on this, I think responsible sell-down is ok (ex: paying down debt, live comfortably without financial stress, paying for children's schooling, etc). Fred Wilson really sums it up well in this post

* **<a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/08/how-to-mine-bitcoins/" target="_blank">How to Mine Bitcoins</a>**. Anyone interested in joining me in a Bitcoin pool? I think this could be quite interesting exercise and an opportunity to better understand block chain technologies and the potential future of fintech

* **<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEtyI23lIlE" target="_blank">Tristan Walker on TWiSt</a>**. Walker is the founder of Bevel, a consumer goods company focused on health and beauty products for people of color. Walker put in his time at Foursquare and as EIR at Andreessen Horowitz prior to founding Bevel. He discusses his stotry and all things entrepreneurship, culture, tech and bringing the NY hustle to Silicon Valley
