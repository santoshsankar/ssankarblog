Summary: Perspective on making the app menu customizable to fit the user. The setup could yield valuable insights on what the user finds important & relevant.

I am working on a side project right now where I have essentially taken on the role of a product manager. I have spent time thinking through the initial storyboard but when looking at the flow and interactions, I am thinking through the suitable menu for a powerful "call to action." Consider this me thinking out loud to some degree...

I am learning and being cognizant of the great apps I use everyday and trying to transpose that thinking into my design. On my whiteboard I immediately put up the infamous and sometimes hated, hamburger. However, I was quick to recall how some of my most frequented apps often times bunch all their most useful functions "between the buns."

Thinking further, people are different, as such, their patten of usage across the same app is likely quite different too, so why should the menu be static?

So what could occur to help evolve the menu bar? There cannot be a standard across all apps or even similar types so what can we do? I was trying to think out of the box and question whether bespoke menu bars are a possible de facto standard.

# Bespoke Menus

*Apps should have easily customizable menus*, whether it's a drag/drop or an ordinal ranking of items. Depending on the menu bar of an app, users can fill up the slots to their liking. It's such a simple idea which I feel could improve the experience with an increase in user satisfaction and interactions driven by a simple personalization. So far, personalization has been limited to cases like social networks, email and messaging but it could extend in a simple manner across any app. 

## Data Driven UI/UX

The ability to customize the menu also *shows the product team what users are prioritizing and find important through data*. Teams can then ask if it jives with their beliefs or checks out to the results from user testing. If it does, great. If not, then it can reveal the actuality of what is going on in your user base. Another hokey (and perhaps wrong) idea-- such insight could cut down on the volume of testing-- since the data is there and yours to analyze.

## What About the Default?

The question now is, that's great but you still need a default menu. And for that, I say, there are two approaches:

1. **Traditional Configuration.** Just like normal, one could set the menu for the user and then allow them to discover that it can be made bespoke. User testing, precedents, etc can help with setting this up. Essentially, the status quo.
2. **Part of the Users Setup.** Blend it into the user set up process, perhaps it's the last step. Offer a way to rank the menu preference (perhaps offering a suggestion on configuration) since users may not know what is best without extensive interaction. Approaching it this way is also a natural way of making the user aware that they can bespoke-fit the interface. It could also show what users believe is the value proposition or interesting aspect of your offering.

Now this is an idea that popped into my head and I know that most people might say that one should know their users well enough to offer a fixed menu to suit their needs. That's great but I think this is a unique and effective way to improve the user experience while learning about a user's values and preferences. It might impede traffic to certain parts of your app (if they swap out a quick icon) but doesn't that just mean that, that part of the app lacks value? That it needs to be retooled, rethought or perhaps done away with?

I am going to head back to the drawing board and continue to chip away at development but found this to be valuable. I likely will not prioritize this to implement into the MVP but certainly something important to address in the future. For more mature apps, this could be a great addition that a user could perhaps embrace since they dictate the UI/UX of the app by altering the main menu.
