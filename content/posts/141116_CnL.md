Good Morning from Chattanooga! After a busy week traveling to San Fran for work, it was great to get outdoors and enjoy what I think is the most underrated city in the country. Later this week, I will be sharing a great Kickstarter from a quality team here that is pioneering eco-friendly tree houses with full gigabit internet access. On that note-- enjoy this week's reads!

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status= " target="_blank">share</a> this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://www.wired.com/2014/11/on-david-marcus-and-facebook/" target="_blank">How Zuck & an ex-PayPal CEO Plan to Run Messenger</a>**. Probably the best article I have read this week- takes us through the story of how PayPal CEO Marcus was lured away by Zuckerberg to transform and manage Facebook Messenger. We also get a glimpse into the duo's plans for the app

* **<a href = "http://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/11/12/unrest-nest/" target="_blank">Unrest at Nest</a>**. Some cultural problems might be surfacing at Nest, a leader in the smart home. Insiders have gone as far to dub the leadership hierarchy as similar to the "Game of Thrones"

* **<a href = "http://www.theequitykicker.com/2014/11/12/designing-experiences/" target="_blank">Designing Experiences</a>**. Discussion around the design of experiences and how they must evoke emotion. A great point I enjoyed was rephrasing the question to ‘design a better way for people to enjoy flowers in the home’ than to ‘design a new vase.’ Quite powerful given it makes us focus on the experience of the product vs just the product

* **<a href = "http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2014/12/uber-travis-kalanick-controversy" target="_blank">Great Profile of Uber Founder, Travis Kalanick</a>**. Re/code Editor, Kara Swisher penned this great profile of the controversial Uber Founder. Kalanick has come under-fire for his cavalier and sometimes questionable business tactics. Given I'm a long-time Uber user, to me, it's important to support an ethical business and this is a situation I monitor closely

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@johnolilly/happy-10th-firefox-33ddae0a5b42" target="_blank">Happy 10th Birthday to Firefox</a>**. For as long as I can remember, prior to Chrome making a splash and winning me over, I was a Firefox supporter (predecessors included). This past week Firefox turned 10-years old and a former CEO pens his congratulations and highlights Firefox's place in the Internet landscape as the institution that takes on seemingly impossible tasks 

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@johnolilly/happy-10th-firefox-33ddae0a5b42" target="_blank">Happy 10th Birthday to Firefox</a>**. For as long as I can remember, prior to Chrome making a splash and winning me over, I was a Firefox supporter (predecessors included). This past week Firefox turned 10-years old and a former CEO pens his congrats and highlights Firefox's place in the Internet landscape as the institution that takes on seemingly impossible tasks 

* **<a href = "http://blog.samaltman.com/board-members" target="_blank">Board Member Composition</a>**. YC President, Sam Altman penned this concise perspective on Board composition. Having just discussed this very point with a team I am working with, my thinking was validated by Altman. Five people which includes founders, investors and an outsider-- give it a read  

* **<a href = "http://www.fastcompany.com/3037933/the-visible-man" target="_blank">A Profile of Tristan Walker</a>**. Quite possibly the most popular piece going around the startup and technology community. Walker is founder of Bevel a consumer products company targeting the needs of African Americans. On the way, Walker is breaking barriers for minorities by going against all odds and proving that anyone can be successful without necessarily being apart of the "in" crowd

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.myyearprinted.com/" target="_blank">My Year Printed</a>**. Shared this on Product Hunt earlier this week thinking it could make a cool Christmas gift. This app allows you to connect to your Instagram account and select a set of pictures to print on a poster. Prices start at $40

* **<a href = "http://www.companionapp.io/" target="_blank">Companion</a>**. This is a personal safety device that helps individuals get home safely. You can select a handful of people that can monitor your trek home and are notified once you reach home. If anything goes awry on the way home, your "companions" are notified and local authorities are a tap away

* **<a href = "https://onename.io/" target="_blank">OneName</a>**. As a huge supporter of Bitcoin and Blockchain, OneName uses the blockchain for user ID verification. This is one of those opportunities that is still young and in the first round, sign up as an early adopter and join in on the ride

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bitbite-track-and-improve-your-eating-habits--3" target="_blank">BitBite</a>**. Perhaps it is *how* we eat as much as *what* we eat. BitBite is the world's first wearable device that monitors eating habits and helps improve them. While I have not thought through the technology to validate the effectiveness, a cool idea nonetheless

* **<a href = "http://www.typegenius.com/" target="_blank">Type Genius</a>**. I love looking at various type faces and their role in design. Different types evoke different reactions and play an important role in building a quality UX. Even if you aren't a builder, perhaps this could be interesting for your next report or presentation
