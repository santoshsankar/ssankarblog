Summary: My thoughts on bringing voting into the digital age with a secure solution that leverages the prevalence of mobile devices. With the help of leading designers, engineers and security specialists, I think a solution could be developed in a successful public/private partnership.

I voted early this morning here in NY State and laughed as I filled out my ballot at how antiquated the process was. The elderly citizen-volunteers likely had smartphones more powerful than the counting machines in the corner-- the only sign of technology in the whole process.

I read <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3037914/an-app-to-redesign-how-we-vote" target="_blank">this</a> article from Wired about what I consider to be a weak attempt at modernizing voting. While I do not know what red tape was instituted by the Presidential Commission on Election Administration, I feel like the proposed app only gets half way there.

## Voting in the Digital Age

I think all the pieces are in place to improve the voting process with simpler, more efficient and effective solutions. This is how I think voting should occur.

* **Period of Education**. Ahead of elections there should be a daily or weekly digest of pertinent, *non-partisan, non-biased* information. In general, our population is undereducated on topics related to law, economics and governance. Can't expect intelligent votes without some attempt at educating the populous

* **Election Day**. With the prevalence of mobile devices, I believe that everyone should be able to vote wherever they are. This rids us of the issue of absentee ballots and theoretically improves the voting participation rate. I envision something like this:

1. Wake up and there's an email or push reminder that it's election day

2. The system random invites chunks of the population to vote, so as not to stress the systems. The issue of high volume can be addressed throughout the day by scaling systems up/down as needed

3. To secure the process, it seems that there are a variety of options including TouchID and heartbeat biometrics. See security below.

4. The ballot is well designed and <a href ="http://jerz.setonhill.edu/design/usability/use-ballot.htm" target="_blank">not misleading</a>. Options can be showed one at a time, in text that is not so small I need a magnifying glass (perhaps a Tinder-like interface?)

5. After one completes the voting process they can go back and check their entries

6. Prior to submission, it seems like it would make sense to confirm then reverify credentials (based on point 3)


* **Post-Voting**. This is what people are most interested in, the results. Therefore the app could be a one-stop dashboard for results. After submitting a vote, the individual can populate a "feed" with media sources they frequent. This is important to offer AFTER voting so as to not bias the voter

## Other Points

* **Security**. People have long ranted on about how technology in voting will expose us to risks. That's true but there are risks to any process. With paper, there is the risk of loss, damage, sabotage, etc. Software security is constantly improving and there's generally always a means to address risks that a paper ballot does not offer. If that risk was so large, would the ballot-counting machines be connected to the Internet? (I assume they are). Such a digital effort will require the efforts of several constituents but to think that public and private entities do not have technology and talent worthy of tackling this issue seems naive.
    In regards to the device-side security, I think there are a number of approaches. I'm no expert but one could use a multi-factor authentication, combining what I know (password), I have (device), I am, (biometric) and where I am (geofence) could be relatively simple and effective

* **Design**. I forgot about that 2000 ballot until by HCI class this summer (come on, I was in middle school). I am still shocked by how awful that ballot was. This is something Intuitive Voting seems to do well

* **People & Talent**. We want jobs don't we? Well I think my idea creates quite a few across many disciplines. We would need unbiased authors and data scientists to help educate voters, engineers, designers, managers, support, security specialists, etc

This is all easier said than done and while I believe a lot of smart people have thought about this I think the scope of thought is too constrained. The whole process needs to be undone and reengineered in what I think would be a great public-private opportunity.
