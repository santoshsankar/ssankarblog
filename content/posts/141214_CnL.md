Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

This week marked the first snow in NYC and it finally feels like Christmas. For our friends on the West Coast, this week brought some much-needed rain with the "superstorm." Regardless, hope everyone is enjoying themselves and *living in the moment, not counting down the days till 2015. Make the most of what you have, today.*

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please share this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://www.christinacacioppo.com/blog/build-products" target="_blank">A Former VC's Thoughts on Learning to Building Products</a>**.  A great piece on what it takes to code and build products. Highly recommend this especially if you're looking to learn how to code and build your own things

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/activity-based-pricing/" target="_blank">Product: Activity Based Pricing</a>**. Given I'm spending my weekends at GA in their Product Management course, this seemed relevant to me. A high-level crash course on understanding when/why a product is priced based on consumption or activity

* **<a href = "http://sparkcapital.tumblr.com/post/104760637181/adapting-okrs-for-your-startup" target="_blank">Product Management: Objectives, and Key Results</a>**. Things need to get done and communicating that clearly is important-- OKRs can help. Identify key objectives to accomplish in a time frame, find ways to measure them effectively and then summarize the outcomes

* **<a href = "http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/12/07/if-you-dont-respect-your-customers-you-wont-be-successful/" target="_blank">Importance of Respecting Customers</a>**. When it comes down to it, customers are the lifeblood of any business. With all the press recently around Uber, this is a reminder that respecting customers is a must. No organization is above them and that a high-handed attitude could harm your finances

* **<a href = "http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/12/3/how-many-people-really-care-about-google-services" target="_blank">How Sticky Are Google Services</a>**? "What I wonder, then, is how much one can say that these Google services are very broad but very shallow. They address a need that a small number of people feel very deeply but that many more people may feel only occasionally, if ever. We know, for example, that the typical Gmail user gets five emails a day, 'mostly commercial'. How committed are they to Google?"

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.grammarly.com/chrome/chrome_plugin.html" target="_blank">Grammarly</a>**. A Chrome plugin that checks for spelling and grammar errors, on-the-fly. I use along with Draft to write the blog. A must-have for everyone

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/adamleeb/hemingwrite-a-distraction-free-digital-typewriter" target="_blank">Hemingwrite</a>**. Paying homage to the era of the typewriter, this is an e-ink, distraction-free typewriter that also blends the power of the cloud. One can focus on writing while worrying about editing later. Documents can sync with various cloud and note providers such as Google and Evernote

* **<a href = "https://robinhood.com/" target="_blank">Robinhood</a>**. I've shared Robinhood before but it is worth sharing again with the launch of their new iOS app. For those of you looking for a low-cost way to invest your savings in the stock market, how about you try this FREE app. Yes, free-- it's awesome

* **<a href = "https://workflow.is/" target="_blank">Workflow</a>**. Automate the repetitive tasks you complete on your phone. Pretty cool app that could chip away at those seconds and minutes spent orchestrating data between apps. For iOS only

* **<a href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wakie-social-alarm-clock/id879488038?mt=8" target="_blank">Wakie</a>**. This is an interesting product for iOS. Wakie allows you to wake up and get woken up by someone else through your phone-- I need to try this out
