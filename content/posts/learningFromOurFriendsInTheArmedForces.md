Summary: A BIG thank you to those who've served and continue to serve in an effort to secure the liberties we have here in the US. Reflecting on my observations, there are some traits and qualities we should seek to adopt from our friends in the Armed Forces.

A **BIG** thank you to those who've served and continue to serve in an effort to secure the liberties we have here in the US. Over the years, I've met and befriended several Vets who've shared some common traits that one could attribute to their various successes. Reflecting on my observations, there are some traits and qualities we should seek to adopt from them.

1. **Discipline.** As humans, this is probably one of the hardest traits to develop and often times I even find myself making excuses that justify a lack of discipline. Getting in a routine and not wavering from it barring extreme circumstances is tough. While discipline is a byproduct of military training, it is something many of my Veteran friends still exemplify today whether it is with diet, working out or work ethic

2. **Respect.** Sadly, I feel like we all enter situations where we have lapses in character and do not offer basic respect for others (impatience, yelling or name-calling). Watch how our men and women in the Armed Forces carry themselves- they respect each other and those around them. If we can adopt even a small percentage of the respect they exhibit in our daily lives, the world would be a better place

3. **Self-Awareness.** This is HUGE especially amongst Millenials (my generation. Our technology-wrangling attitude has caused many of our older counterparts to believe we lack awareness to some degree. While I have no experience to draw from, it would seem reasonable that as an individual in the armed forces, each individual needs to understand and beware of how their behavior impacts others in their unit. Next time you step into a group, take time to notice and be cognizant of how you come off, what you say, what you do, et al

4. **Ownership.** I had the opportunity to work alongside an individual who served in Vietnam and it taught me what ownership really meant. Regardless of his interest level, he would make sure that he personally accounted for every detail in the deliverables him and his team were responsible for. As a senior figure, he reinforced in me that ownership and accountability went beyond one's personal responsibilities, extending to each team member one led

5. **Tenacity.** We've all read the type of training elite units like the SEALS or Green Berets go through. It builds a level of mental strength that helps them lead and operate in the most difficult situations with poise. That ability to execute to achieve success regardless of obstacles is something I really admire. While the majority of us will never see the obstacles seen in conflict, we can work to solve problems and be constructive when facing challenges

While the list can go on, these really stuck out to me and I often times feel are overlooked. Are there any other traits or qualities you feel we should adopt from our Armed Forces?
