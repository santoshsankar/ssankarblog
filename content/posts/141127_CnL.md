## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://www.fastcolabs.com/3038792/what-i-learned-from-building-an-app-for-low-income-americans" target="_blank">Learnings From Building An App For Low-Income Americans</a>**. Great read about developing smartphone apps for lower income citizens. "To some extent technology has failed low-income Americans too. Developers donâ€™t build apps for them. Growth hackers ignore them. At Significance Labs, I learned a lot about how low-income Americans live and use technology but also about its limitations"

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/fundamental-unit-of-saas-growth/" target="_blank">The Fundamental Unit of SaaS Growth</a>**. SaaS, for those who don't know is when software is centrally located and delivered as a service or "on-demand." Think of it as Google Docs (Productivity Apps as a Service) or Uber (Cabs as a Service / on-demand cabs). Tunguz takes us through the fundamental unit (the minimum number of people in the marketing, sales and support roles to be able to support X customers and generate Y in revenue) of growth in these types of businesses

* **<a href = "http://www.inc.com/magazine/201412/burt-helm/airbnb-company-of-the-year-2014.html" target="_blank">Airbnb, Inc 2014 Company of the Year</a>**. A huge fan of Airbnb after staying with three different Airbnb hosts this past summer in Ireland. An awesome profile of the business, founders and their ascent to success. Great to see them win this prestigious award

* **<a href = "http://joel.mn/post/103546215249/the-blockchain-application-stack" target="_blank">Understanding how Blockchain Could Evolve App Architecture</a>**. With everyone trying to figure out how to incorporate blockchain into future applications and business models, the team at Union Square Ventures are taking a crack. This is more of a working piece and a starting point for discussion. A bit technical but anyone interested in "why bitcoin is important?" should read it

* **<a href = "http://cdixon.org/2014/11/19/a-man-will-be-able-to-carry-one-in-his-vest-pocket/" target="_blank">Pretty Cool Prediction by Nikola Tesla</a>**. In 1926, Tesla predicted the rise of smartphones and the prevalence of today's connected, digital experiences

* **<a href = "http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/11/25/web-iq/" target="_blank">Pew Research: WebIQ</a>**. An interesting survey of about 1,000 Americans regarding their basic knowledge of the Internet. Prior to reading the article, give the survey a shot. My Results: You scored better than 98.7% of the public, below <1% and the same as 1.1%

* **<a href = "http://a16z.com/2014/11/21/a16z-podcast-ecommerce-and-the-holiday-shopping-collision/" target="_blank">a16z Podcast: Ecommerce and the Holiday Shopping Collision</a>**. On the eve of Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming up, why not get some educated views on ecommerce? Jeff Jordan of a16z, formerly of eBay and current Board Member at Pintrest and investor in Instacart, Zulily, etc shares his thoughts on a variety of points related to ecommerce

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flow-an-intuitive-precise-wireless-controller" target="_blank">Flow</a>**. Ditching the mouse for a more precise input tool- Flow. Ever feel like the scroll wheel overdoes it? Flow offers an easy, precise option for users and is currently available for $99 through Indiegogo. They detail the design and engineering process <a href="https://medium.com/@senic/how-we-built-flow-c83dea6ca377" target="_blank">here</a>

* **<a href = "http://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/ProductDisplay_Gramovox%20Bluetooth%20Gramophone_10451_10001_195316_-1_26708_56161_195320" target="_blank">Gramovox Bluetooth Gramophone</a>**. Likely the single most expensive product I have put on here. This is a well designed homage to the 1920s Magnavox R3 horn speaker but now with Bluetooth. Designed and sold by the MoMA Kickstarter partnership

* **<a href = "http://bladeandskillet.com/" target="_blank">Blade & Skillet</a>**. Yet another food-related product but this is focused on helping us be better cooks. For $1.95/month on a 12-month term, one gets access to videos helping amateurs cook gourmet-quality meals. It could be a great gift for new grads or that aspiring chef (that could use the help) in your life

* **<a href = "https://tindddle.com/" target="_blank">Tindddle</a>**. A "tinder" for digital product designs. It runs the gamut from graphics, mobile apps to website interfaces. Pretty good, food-coma, couch-time, time-wasting app

* **<a href = "http://writerack.com/" target="_blank">WriteRack</a>**. An online tweetstorm generator. I have tried a couple other solutions with little success but low and behold, this works great (check my test Tweets from 11/25 around 1pm). If you're into 140+ character tweet sessions, give it a go
