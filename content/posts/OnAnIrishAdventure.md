Summary: Whenever I am on vacation, I learn not only about the local culture, history, food & language but walk away with a broader understanding and appreciation of technology.

It's important for us to take breaks from our busy careers and daily routines to experience the world around us. As such, I'm off to Ireland later today for a period of 12 days. I promised myself a couple years ago that I'll travel to a new country every year given that I was blessed with the resources to do so. While this year's destination might not be amazingly exotic, it was selected mainly to accommodate seeing Penn State Football kick off the season against the University of Central Florida.

Given that international wireless plans are still wildly expensive, disconnecting (for the most part) should not be difficult. I will still Tweet and post cool pictures to my Instagram account-- benefits of WiFi and a small (yet expensive) data plan.

Whenever I travel abroad, I learn a lot. This is not just limited to culture, language, food or geography but also about technology. Whether it's the historical innovations that have been birthed from a city or the types of devices locals prefer, I walk away with a broader understanding and appreciation of technology.

While in Ireland, I hope to be able to observe and think about (in no particular order):

* Popular apps
* Popular mobile devices (brands, models, OS)
* Creative applications of common technology we tend to not see here in the US
* Messaging platforms of choice (SMS vs Viber vs WhatsApp vs Facebook)
* Adoption of wearables
* Computing habits (always on? phones present at the dinner table? anxiety when separated from devices or connections?)
* Prevalence of payments technology
* General attitude towards entrepreneurship and innovation
* Any noteworthy dynamics as it relates to start up and innovation ecosystems

This is what came to mind from my previous experiences and observations. Hopefully I will observe more than what I just listed and be able to experience the different and the unpredictable. On that note, be back in 12 days.
