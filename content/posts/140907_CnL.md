Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

I'm back and it has been go-go-go since I landed. Glad I was able to get some sleep this weekend in an effort to get my circadian rhythm back in order. And without further ado, this week's piece. As always, a share is much appreciated!

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@petersimsie/how-andreessen-horowitz-is-disrupting-silicon-valley-208041d6375d" target="_blank">How Andreessen Horowitz is Disrupting Silicon Valley</a>**. An interesting Medium piece that looks at how AH has improved the traditional VC model by leading with superb sales and marketing. A must read for anyone and everyone looking to understand the business better. 

* **<a href = "http://www.cnet.com/news/google-says-android-wear-about-to-get-even-smarter-q-a/" target="_blank">Interview with the Head Engineers of Android Wear</a>**. A great Q&A with the lead engineers of Android Wear. The piece is very timely given the new watch announcements that were made at IFA Berlin and the upcoming event next week in Cupertino. For all those considering a smart watch purchase this year, this might answer some of the questions you have around adoption, innovation and use cases.

* **<a href = "http://readwrite.com/2014/09/03/big-data-adoption-cio-it-companies?utm_content=bufferefda0&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer&_escaped_fragment_=" target="_blank">Does Your CIO Know If You're Using Big Data?</a>** A piece that analysts, regardless of function- business, marketing, technology, operations, etc will enjoy. It gives credit to those individuals doing the number crunching and making the data-driven decisions. I will note however, that many large companies are increasingly adding Chief Data Officers to oversee the collection, storage, use and governance of their information.

* **<a href = "http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20140902/TECHNOLOGY/308319990/fintech-reshapes-wall-street" target="_blank">Fintech is Reshaping Wall Street</a>**. Working on Wall Street, I have seen the interest in fintech increase the last several years. To take a snippet from the article, "Though tech adoption is slower on the enterprise side, financial companies are increasingly looking to buy or partner with startups. Gartner, a tech research and advisory company based in Stamford, Conn., estimates that banking and securities institutions will invest $486 billion in information technology in 2014."

* **<a href = "http://steveblank.com/2014/09/03/should-founders-know-how-to-code/" target="_blank">Steve Blank on Why Founders Should Know How to Code</a>**. A great piece from Steve Blank on why founders should know how to code. He references his conversation during a long car ride with a non-technical founder that he mentors. It really resonates with me and supports the Swift programming class I am taking on the side.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.dyson360eye.com/" target="_blank">Dyson 360 Eye</a>**. Having grown up where my mom vacuumed the house daily, multiple times and even before the cleaners came, this stuck out to me. How awesome would an all-seeing robot be as a teenager? Forget chores, there are better things to focus on out there.

* **<a href = "https://helloblock.io/" target="_blank"> Hello Block</a>**. Stripe for Bitcoin. I think these guys are on to something big as the blockchain (and alternative digital currency, in general) gets more attention. Whether it's Bitcoin or something else that wins out, Hello Block could offer a backend to facilitate payments.

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/myqblinks/iscent-smell-your-ringtone?ref=category_featured" target="_blank">iScent</a>**. I found this really interesting because it essentially allows us to control smell with technology. To my knowledge, this was one of the last senses (taste being the other) we cannot incorporate in an app yet. We have touch, vision and sound thus far. If this does take off, it could be an interesting and hopefully just the first step in incorporating smell into mobile technology.

* **<a href = "https://www.localfu.com/" target="_blank">LocalFu</a>**. This is similar to an idea my friends and I had around travel. Great to see someone tapping into the intelligence of locals to assist in better travel planning. What currently exists gives travelers and tourists a voice at the expense of locals. After all, who knows the hidden gems of a given location better than the people living there?

* **<a href = "https://designthencode.com/" target="_blank">Designing Animations for iOS</a>**. Given I am taking a Swift course right now, I thought this was pretty cool. A great, affordable book that helps one design stellar iOS animations.
