Summary: The loyalty card is common but it annoys me that it gets manually punched (or swiped) every time I purchase a meal or drink. There has to be a better approach (cause the current options don't seem to be cutting it).

As part of my daily routine, I tend to get a coffee and lunch during the day. In the last few weeks, the place I get my afternoon caffeine has reverted to cardboard punch cards from a plastic card. The loyalty card is common but it annoys me that it gets manually punched (or swiped) every time I purchase a meal or drink. Why do I care?

* I don't always remember my card
* I tend to accumulate cards that sometimes cannot be consolidated
* I forget what I got last time and it would help to know
* Getting punched during peak hours slows down the line (inefficiency)
* Merchants lose out on easy "get to know your customer" opportunities (yes this does bother me)

There <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/7-apps-to-take-your-customer-loyalty-program-mobile-7000025654/" target="_blank">are</a> several digital options but I still think this aspect of the customer experience has opportunities. My perspective also is seemingly reinforced by the fact that the majority of independent merchants still use a manual process (understood as waste) to address this function. I'm not a whiz on the space but based on what I observe, I thought the below are a few areas a winning solution could address.

1. **Loyalty not a focus (yet)**. Currently, the focus is on payments due to the sizable (and more immediate) revenue opportunities. As it stands, the loyalty component is an afterthought but these players could offer a well designed solution once payments have been addressed. However, in era where users want privacy and new payment platforms (claim) to offer that, this type of rewards system could be more difficult to implement. While there are opt-in methods one could design, more clicks leads to the next point-- high friction.

2. **High friction, not enough incentives**. A lot of the current solutions require users to change their behavior or take some additional action that is not balanced with a "reward." For example, I've seen LevelUp for several years on/off at a handful of merchants with a limited number of people actually using it. The opt-in process to assuage privacy concerns also increases friction but with proper incentives could work. Users need a reason to act (and simple discounts might not work)-- what other incentives can be offered?

3. **App sprawl.** A huge annoyance is that once a merchant reaches a certain size, they tend to have their own app-- which is fine but the minimal value proposition isn't. It would be great for "loyalty" to be a one-stop solution regardless of brand, product or location. The challenge will be to capture the microlevel transaction data that the card companies are privy to. That could be tackled in a number of ways but goes back to the fact that those parties working on payments technology could quickly refocus and tackle loyalty efforts from a powerful position

My two cents after trying some solutions, ditching others and reviewing several only to realize they don't offer substantial value. Anyone out there have any thoughts or ideas on the topic?
