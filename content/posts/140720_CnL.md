Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Sorry for the delay with getting this written and published. I had some friends in town so we spent the days and nights, exploring new restaurants, bars and enjoying a NYC summer weekend. Given that this is 12 hours late, it might be better described as Dessert & Links.

I wanted to launch a new section of this weekly piece in addition to the interesting links. While I was time pressed this weekend, I plan to add it next week. Stay tuned! I think all readers will enjoy it. With that, this week's selection of readings:

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/twitter-best-practices/?utm_content=buffer742f4&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer" target ="_blank">Data-driven Content Sharing on Twitter</a>**. Interesting analysis around the dynamics of sharing content on Twitter. While some of the results from Tunguz's analysis might seem intuitive, it's pretty useful/powerful to see.

* **<a href = "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/silicon-valley-obsessing-over-smartwatches.html?mid=twitter_dailyintelligencer" target= "_blank">Are Technophiles the Only People Who Want Smart watches?</a>**. With wearables garnering significant attention from media and industry, this is a great and timeline perspective on the smart watch opportunity. Roose has broken down the consumer dynamics, technology and even business impact of the various devices currently (and soon to be) on the market.
 
* **<a href = "http://www.wired.com/2014/07/google_brain/" target="_blank">The Google Brain</a>**. Simply put, “Google is not really a search company. It's a machine-learning company.” This is a great read and a point I have observed as it relates to Google and is quickly spreading across many other players.

* **<a href = "http://thenextweb.com/lifehacks/2014/07/17/science-of-side-projects/" target="_blank">Science of Side Projects</a>**. Seeing how I enjoy having a side project or two, I really appreciated this psychological analysis of side projects. The venn diagram is a great visualization as it relates to the joint dynamics of pressure, risk and passion when we establish and work on these away-from-work ventures.

* **<a href = "http://www.feld.com/archives/2014/07/angellist-syndicate-feedback-experienced-entrepreneur.html" target="_blank">Feedback on Angel List-- Entrepreneur's View</a>**. I always think its interesting to hear feedback from customers around a product or service. This candid feedback on AngelList and the fund raising process from the perspective of an entrepreneur is quite interesting.

I am running a <a href="goo.gl/nCAGYw" target="_blank">survey</a> that I would be grateful if you participated in (and pass on to friends) -- you could win an Amazon gift card! As always, a share or retweet would be much appreciated.
