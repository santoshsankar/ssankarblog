Summary: For my first product, I wanted something that related to my interests in travel and private charity-- ePostcards for a Cause.

Over the last week or so, I've been reviewing my ideas to figure out which one I want to hack together. I wanted a tangible project whereby I can apply my business skills as well as my newfound design and technical lessons from my HCI and Swift classe(s), respectively. 

For the last year or so, I have kept a long list of "opportunities" I've faced both personally and at work where technology-driven solutions could leave a mark. For my first product though, I wanted something that related to my interests in travel and private charity.

# ePostcards for A Cause

I love to travel and capture the sights and sounds to share with friends and family. To give credit where credit is due, part of my inspiration came from a close friend that always sends a postcard wherever he goes. He managed to send one from Kenya last spring while on a mission trip. As I looked at my collection from over the years, it got me thinking. 

In a digital world, why don't we take advantage of low cost to share digital postcards of sorts? There are plenty of postcard apps out there that take your smartphone pictures and mail out physical copies but none seem to **own** a digital experience. After further thought, I resigned myself to the fact that Instagram and to some degree, Snapchat help address this.

After a night's sleep, I advanced my thinking beyond the broadcasting of pictures or ephemeral messaging. I assembled my thinking as such:

1. **Use the phone's camera.** People enjoy sharing their experiences with loved ones and camera snaps are one of the (if not most) popular way to do this

2. **Digital can be personal.** What people share should be personal, hence I place importance on the ability to take the picture as well as writing the message. Traditional postcards tend to be preselected, something I have never been a fan of. Digital should also not hinder the perception of "personal." To address this, I thought of controls to prevent excessive reuse of a picture (afterall, it's not like one postcard is kept in large quanities), "postage" for each postcard with a limited amount of digital stamps and maintaining a close personal experience (more like messaging vs a network)

3. **Digital can offer permanence.** The memory shared (the ePostcard) should be permanent, hence the digital medium
 
4. **"Postage for a Cause."** It's important to "pay it forward" and help ensure great experiences are preserved and offered to anyone interested in experiencing them. As such, why not "charge" postage in the form of a token donation (I'm talking 50 cents to a few dollars) that can be made to a charity in the name of the postcard's recipient. While there might need to be a small surcharge to process this, I would imagine it to be affordable (or maybe use Bitcoin?)

In regards to the charities that could be offered, I was thinking about offering them up based on the location the picture was captured. A select menu of causes that benefit the local community could offer users options to select something that they're interested in.

So lets say my pictures of Kerry, Ireland came out amazing (which they did) and I wanted to share one of them with my friends. I could launch the app, select the picture (or take one on-the-spot), write a message, sign it by hand (using your finger) then send it. While confirming my recipients, I would also select a charity to benefit for $0.50 per recipient.

What was gained? A low cost, permanent way of sharing a memory while contributing to a cause that hopefully will help the local community that I enjoyed. It can help ensure that local landmarks are preserved, structures get the proper restoration funding, fund local tourism initiatives or even support efforts around hygiene and cleanliness (important!).

Granted, I need a better name, there are wrinkles to iron out and further holes to poke but this seems quite compelling. The design above is just a quick first attempt at the "postbox" where all of one's received postcards will be visible. Thoughts?
