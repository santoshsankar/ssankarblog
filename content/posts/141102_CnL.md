Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

The year has flown by, already November 2nd. One of my mentors tells me the years just fly by the older we get... seems like there's some truth to it. With a couple months left in the year, it's time to look at all those goals from January 1st. I might have bit a little more than I could chew but I would say most things were accomplished. We'll see what else I can knock off in the next two months. Now on to the reads--

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status=http://goo.gl/hkR0OB" target="_blank">share</a> this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "https://www.futurerising.com/story/advice/how-to-get-more-involved-in-the-startup-scene" target="_blank">Getting Involved in the Startup Scene</a>**. A great article with tips and approaches to build a network and get involved in your local startup scene. I know this will interest many readers

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/investor-location-round-size/" target="_blank">Does Investor Location Impact Their VC Investments?</a>**. Exploratory analysis reveals an answer that is quite interesting. While the answer might seem obvious, note that it was proven that a startup's location does *not* matter when they attempt to raise capital

* **<a href = "http://avc.com/2014/10/sidechains/" target="_blank">Introducing the Idea of Sidechains</a>**. Fred Wilson introduces the concept of sidechains, essentially an extension of the core bitcoin blockchain--which helps address weaknesses while leveraging its strengths. While I think this is still very much a work-in-progress, it could be quite useful as we explore different uses for the blockchain. <a href="http://www.blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf" target="_blank">Here's the paper</a>. Perhaps some fodder for a future blog post...

* **<a href = "https://medium.com/@EngineOrg/every-city-can-be-a-startup-city-the-promise-of-entrepreneurship-across-america-f6bb42adb562" target="_blank">How Every City Can Be a Startup Hub</a>**. A good piece describing the components that when brought together and cultivated, can turn any city or region into a burgeoning startup hub. I have long held this belief and you can see this playing out in areas like: Pittsburgh, Chattanooga and Cincinnati to name a few

* **<a href = "http://seriousstartups.com/2014/08/21/conversions-matter-traffic/" target="_blank">Understanding Why Conversions Matter More Than Views</a>**. A good beginner piece on the concept of conversions vs views. This is a good crash course as to how sites track movement leading up to a sale (or no sale) and think about optimizing that conversion rate

* **<a href = "http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-copresence-improve-android-ios-relations/" target="_blank">Improving Android/iOS Relations</a>**. Code updates indicate that Google is working on a new feature called Copresence that will make it easier to transfer files between devices. The cool part? iOS devices can get it on the action. Seems like Google is willing to play nice...

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1277630932/dexmo-an-exoskeleton-for-you-to-touch-the-digital?ref=category_featured" target="_blank">Dexmo</a>**. An exoskeleton that helps one touch the digital world. Enough said-- check it out. I might be looking to back this-- really cool

* **<a href = "https://reserve.com/" target="_blank">Reserve</a>**. From the folks who brought us Uber, meet Reserve. Reserve allows individuals to reserve and pay for meals at high end restaurants. Currently it is available NYC, LA and Boston with more cities to be added shortly. One pays $5, flat fee for use of the app. If you're a no-show then $15-$25 is charged and passed onto the customer

* **<a href = "https://www.fountaingreetings.com/" target="_blank">Fountain Greetings</a>**. Think of this as Greetings as a Service. While it might be controversial that you are not hand writing the note, it might make sense for mass mailings (holiday cards, wedding thank yous, etc). I sometimes feel people get caught up in the action and product vs the message when it comes to greetings and thank you notes

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/slimger-the-slim-charger-for-mobile-devices" target="_blank">Slimger</a>**. The smallest charger I have seen for smartphones and tablets. I carry around a rather large orange backup and always make room for it wherever I go. Now, the Slimger is striving to put one in my wallet. It will be interesting to see if it pans out-- not sure how much juice it will ultimately offer (claims 1400mAh or 5 hours of voice / 4 hours of internet)

* **<a href = "http://www.airpnp.co/" target="_blank">Airpnp</a>**. I HAD TO ADD THIS. Airbnb for toilets. What does that mean? Well what would one need a clean toilet for?
