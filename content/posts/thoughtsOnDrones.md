Summary: A few of my thoughts on drones as it relates to their usage and impact in emerging economies given the increased automation they introduce.

I'd been really mulling a drone purchase for the better part of 2014 and on Christmas Day, I finally got one. After doing my research, I decided to go with an inexpensive drone before spending the big bucks for a more "macho" machine such as the Phantom. I'll tell you, from the little time I've spent with it, it's quite difficult to fly.

As I was doing my research, two thoughts came to mind:
1. What everyone is always pondering-- what could drones do outside of what is already so obvious. We've read about their uses in energy and retail but what else?
2. What most people might not initially consider-- drones effectively could speed up the industrial/economic growth of emerging nations. How does this large step in automation impact developing economies?

Drilling down further...

* **Agriculture**. Agriculture is still a large part of GDP for emerging economies. Furthermore, it's not like food will become less important as the years pass. Drones could be used to monitor remote areas whether it be crop or cattle as well as used as a tool in the farming process(seeding, fertilizer, etc). I'm not an expert in farming, but it seems like the farmer in India shouldn't need to watch his cattle or crop to prevent theft, loss or damage in-person. A cheap drone paired with some inexpensive computers (Arduino or Raspberry Pis) could help him automate mundane tasks and conduct more value-add activities

* **Healthcare**. It shouldn't take days to get basic supplies to remote regions whether it's in disaster zones, emerging or developed regions. As drone technology develops, essential vaccines, medications, formulas could be easily transported in secure, auditable pods. Imagine standing in a medical facility in Kenya, where a drone flies in from a regional outpost with required vaccinations in tamper proof and theft-proof pods. The vials can leave an audit trail based on location and even specific patient to prevent corruption (ex: selling medicine above market prices) or misuse. The needles and other waste materials can be loaded back into the drone which can return it to an area where it might be appropriately disposed

* **Basic Law Enforcement**. This is a pretty controversial topic but hear me out. The use of drones would not be to harm (I would say nothing more than a camera, a durable body and MAYBE a tazer) but more so to monitor. In impoverished areas with only a nascent legal system, drones could be very handy and offer a sense of structure and piece-of-mind. These always-on, monitors can not only alert law enforcement when lawlessness is imminent but also quickly highlight the misuse of power to higher authorities as well as the citizenship

    For example, in 2010, my family was in India and we stopped at a small village in Northern India that holds significance in Hinduism. We had a driver in a pretty standard car who was watching the vehicle for theft while we looked around. Even with him on-guard, a pair of teens were able to steal two of the hubcaps off the tires. While seemingly meaningless to us, this theft easily cost the driver over a day's salary. These simple crimes could be reduced with such oversight, when executed in a responsible (read ethical and incorrupt) manner

    In developing nations especially in places like the US, drones could even monitor police behavior and activity in real-time. Their introduction would put-in-place much-needed checks/balances in the enforcement system. We could put an end to rude, abusive, and entitled behavior from those in "positions of power"

Interesting to think about how at $60, these machines could end up being a part of a broader technology ecosystem and everyday fixtures in our lives. I'm always up to hearing creative ideas and thoughts- please share with me anything else you might have stumbled across or thought up.
