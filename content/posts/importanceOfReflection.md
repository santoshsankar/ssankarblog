Summary: It's great that we're all on-the-go and constantly doing something but reflection offers several benefits: personal growth, an inventory of our knowledge and allows for better mentorship.

I'm in my mid twenties and for the past several months have been exploring and attempting to make a major transition to return to my long term passions. During this time, I feel like one thing that I have learned about myself and the process of personal development is to *make time for reflecting.*

Think about all that one does in any given time frame, I for one spend time learning, doing, fixing, making things, making mistakes,helping others, etc -- the list goes on and on. But it's infrequent that I stop and think about it all.

# Why's it Important?

It's great that we're all on-the-go and constantly doing something but reflection offers several benefits.

1. **Allows for personal growth.** What good is being successful if one cannot replicate it? Dissect why things worked and analyze whether there's a framework to duplicate that across situations and cases. On the flip side, this reflection actually helps one learn from mistakes, not just talk about it. Think about what didn't work, fix it for next time and move on.

2. **Helps us take a "knowledge inventory."** One thing I've realized is that I don't realize or forget about all my experiences. It's important to be aware of what one can do / can't do and knows / doesn't know. This can help position one set more realistic goals, prepare for future opportunities and create better development plans to achieve their goals.

3. **Find better mentors and be a better mentor.** Mentorship is extremely important to help one develop both personally as well in their career. By reflecting on ourselves, we can understand what we look for in our relationships. It allows us to sound out new mentors and ask for more pointed advice from existing mentors. Apart of this is to also share one's knowledge and expertise with those who could benefit from it. In order to be additive as a mentor, reflection helps to frame situations from one's past and disseminate relevant advice.

August is the typical slow month in most industries and a great time to take advantage of this reflection. It turns out having a blog is a great way to distill this information overtime-- sometimes topic selection or consistent detailing can reveal our hidden interests and desires. It doesn't need to be public either but writing (typing) our thought process can prove to be valuable. While it's not exactly half way through the year we still have enough time to improve at the job, in school or at home with our loved ones.
