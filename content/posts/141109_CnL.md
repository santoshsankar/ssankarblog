Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status= " target="_blank">share</a> this with your family and friends.

This post from Charlie O'Donnell really hits the nail on the head here. People get chastised for not agreeing with mainstream thinking. While this addresses the issue in the startup world, I think it's worth sharing in light of the recent elections. We can all get along, work together and even be friends if we just *agree to disagree*

If you've ever heard of an iBeacon and wondered what it is, this is your guide. iBeacons are simply Bluetooth radios that emit a signal which apps programatically respond to. It's greatest strength is bringing micro-location into the sales, marketing and purchasing equation. Adoption is still in early days with first-movers including the NFL and Safeway

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/state-seed-market-q4-2014/" target="_blank">State of the Seed Capital Markets</a>**. With the top three VC states (CA, NY and MA) accounting for 70% of seed capital, relative to 2008, they are investing considerably more at the seed stage. Tunguz thinks the data suggests that it might be a good time to raise seed capital

* **<a href = "http://www.gv.com/lib/biz-stone" target="_blank">Kevin Rose Interviews Biz Stone</a>**. Biz Stone is the co-founder of Twitter and now co-founder and CEO of Jelly.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/playwith-connect-around-sports/id926319910?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">PlayWith</a>**. I feel like the official description really explains this well. "PlayWith is the best and the fastest way to meet new people around the sports and games you love.

Using Bluetooth LE, your app will detect if an object with a Tile attached is nearby or not. This is an application of Beacon technology (as described above)
