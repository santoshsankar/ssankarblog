Summary: I've been spending my free time during the last month working on a couple projects. Through that period of time, I've found my process for exploring and building user experiences/interactions has evolved. Instead of just putting pen-to-paper, I have instead turned to enumerating interactions* as a great starting point-- words first, wireframes second.

I've been spending my free time during the last month working on a couple projects. Through that period of time, I've found that my process for exploring and building user experiences/interactions has evolved. 

*Disclaimer: For some, this might be dumb or irrelevant but I am not a product manager, designer or developer by trade but am increasingly learning and trying my hand (sometimes without choice) in each of these areas.*

While I benefit from bouncing ideas off a team or close friends, I think that wireframing cold is not the best idea and leads to poor product discussions and ultimately, **output**. Instead of just putting pen-to-paper, *I have instead turned to enumerating interactions* as a great starting point-- **words first, wireframes second**.

It might sound crazy, but I've found that a simple outline in <a href="http://www.draftin.com">Draft</a> helps me organize and quickly think through various experiences. I often times do it as apart of my minimum requirements so it does not really impact my workflow too much. I essentially detail out the flow of the basic functionality, screen by screen, from the perspective of a user (in much more detail than user stories and more empathetically than flow charts).

Draft (or any text editor) has ended up acting as a "canvas" that can serve as a guide or checklist when interfaces and experiences are wireframed and/or prototyped.

I've noticed that when I wireframe first before any type of written planning or interaction enumeration, I find myself referencing sites like UX Archive- like a crutch. After a full work day, it ends up being easy to repeat previously used patterns or interfaces without exploring and thinking through 1) what is best for the situation and 2) what can be done that hasn't been yet.

Furthermore, writing also helps humanize the human-computer interactions we're building. I'm not writing abbreviated, robotic descriptions, helper text or responses. We don't communicate to each other like that, so why should our apps be planned (or reflect) something that is inhuman? The confines of a box or tool tip can make us think we need to squeeze or abbreviate ourselves but *in early innings, the emphasis should be on the message, not necessarily making it fit into UI elements*.

While writing flows and experiences, screen-by-screen, to start off might seem odd, I highly recommend it. So far, I've reaped several benefits:

* better product-related meetings with team members and advisors
* clearer focus on *what* the app should do... 
* and better thinking on *how* that can be accomplished
* improved communication to users on the app's value proposition
* easier to show new users how to use the app (onboarding)
* streamlined user experiences-- get rid of unnecessary steps

Next time you have a project on hand, give writing for a quick 20 mins a shot, perhaps you will also gain from a different approach.
