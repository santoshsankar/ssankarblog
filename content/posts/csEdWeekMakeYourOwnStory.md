Summary: It's Computer Science Education Week here in the US where technologists around the country are volunteering to introduce basic computer literacy to students. While there are concentrated efforts to teach students from all paths of life technology skills, I want to emphasize that learning these skills isn't just for children-- adults should learn too. 

It's Computer Science Education Week here in the US where technologists around the country are volunteering to introduce basic computer literacy to students. While there are concentrated efforts to teach students from all paths of life technology skills year-round, I want to emphasize that learning these skills isn't just for children. 

Despite the fact I received my degree in finance, people tend to be shocked that I minored in Information Systems. A deliberate pairing when I was 19 years old given my belief (which is supported by evidence) that we live in an era where technology touches all aspects of business and is a driver of strategy and value. As adults, we should also take advantage of learning opportunities, beyond just this one week to be well equipped in the *basics of computer science*.

## My Story

I had the opportunity to learn BASIC at the age of 7, and soon after began building websites, intially, with the help of Netscape Communicator. As I grew up, I dove head-first in understanding how computers work, both at a hardware and software level. Among other things, I spent my time picking apart old PCs and servers while learning to build products in a variety of languages.

While I recall a fraction of the syntax from programming, what did stick was the understanding and application of relevant concepts. Among other things, I understand the basics of computer systems, interfaces/interactions, implementing a "hack", thinking logically, and identifying situations where I can benefit from adopting an existing technological solution.

My learnings have a profound impact on how I work: tolerate and understand why tech support requests "don't just happen", know why introducing new solutions makes people jumpy, question the cost/benefit of manual tasks, look for ways to automate or improve/never accepting the status quo, have empathy for consumers of technology, et al.

Personally, the most significant learning was that I realized I'm a builder. Nothing beats spending hours, through frustration and road blocks to building something for others and seeing it come to fruition. Despite spending almost five years on Wall Street, I still enjoy building. Today, I'm making initiatives to update my technical understanding, build a better understanding of product management and apply my finance tool kit. 

## Make Your Own Story

I'm not trying to tell you to go become a computer scientist or an expert in systems architecture, UX, data analysis, Python, etc. *No, far from that*. 

What **I'm asking** is to seek and learn the basics to aide in your specific function or stoke that long-standing interest. Learn the basics of Visual Basic to automate a simple daily function or spend a few minutes reading to understand why you can't "just access" Facebook on your work machine.

There will be a variety of feelings along the way some of which might be negative but I assure you at the end it will be well worth it. Go ahead, **make your own story**.

Here're some resources to aide in learning. For those wondering, I don't get any compensation for any of this.
