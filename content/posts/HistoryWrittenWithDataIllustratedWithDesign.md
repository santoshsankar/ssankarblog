Summary: We're passively creating raw autobiographies from the data trails we leave which. While unnerving to some, with good design, they could be visualized and available for the benefit and use of future generations.

From FitBits to Droids, Maps to Twitter, we're leaving an abundance of information about ourselves -- a *"datafied" history* of sorts. In a some sense, we are passively creating raw autobiographies with data trails that depict who we are. 

While today, this datafication is done for the purposes of improved marketing/ads, healthcare, insurance, et al, in the long-run, after it's immediate value has been captured, it will turn into history. **History written with data and illustrated with design.**

Today's technologies will allow future generations to have a broader and more complete understanding of our generation. Anecdotes will be more accurate, visuals will be more detailed and candid, records will have greater integrity and most importantly, **memories wouldn't just be limited to politicians, heroes or businesspeople.** Essentially, we'll be able to paint the very being of an individual, their experiences, community and environment.

# Written with Data

I say that our history will be written with data since everything we do is captured. There's never been a record so great and thorough, and the breadth and depth of information is continuously improving.

From all that data being collected, it's safe to say that for the most part, as it currently stands, less than 5% of it's present value has likely been captured. However, to a historian in 2200 or an anthropologist in 3000, regardless of the 2014 benefit, it allows them to draw insights around how we lived, how events impacted us and in turn, how we impacted the world.

# Illustrated with Design

From all the data being collected, individuals and companies alike are attempting to present it in a meaningful and useful manner. The manipulation and presentation of these complex data sets and relationships are best visualized.

Ultimately, everything curated about us as individuals will be visualized. I spent a weekend at RISD in June and going through the museum, designers have already been attempting to take this approach to their lives with "annual reports."

Similarly, I am thinking we would each have a master record of our lives. Perhaps similar to Facebook's year-in-review-video but all encompassing, not just social media. The merits/demerits of its public/private status is beyond this post but we could likely agree that after our passing (maybe 4-5 years?), we would likely not care whether it's public. 

As an example, let's say my report shows that at the age of 30, I move cross-country. This is cited along with a new job, overlaid with relationship information, tweets showing my interest and put in context with economics and society. This type of report could happen yearly and be collected in a type of life record. Given it's digital, it could be unraveled in a time-series or just kept in more of a "year book" type format-- really up to the viewer.

# Where Might We Reap the Benefits?

## History, Economics & Demographics
While individually, this example might offer too much information and might not have much meaning, collectively across vast populations there is great value. For regional and local history, this microlevel data could document the rise and fall of towns and cities. Historians and demographic experts can better understand and perhaps even quantify the impact leaders, technologies, social evangelists, racial movements and religious beliefs had.

Individual, citizen-level data can be aggregated and linked to companies, industries, regions, strategies and public policy to better calibrate models. An understanding for purchasing tastes, pricing preferences and branding could also be revealed.

## Genealogy
For our future relatives, this would be an exhaustive and definitive guide to genealogy. While the previous areas focus on the sum of the parts, this focuses on the parts, the autobiographies, themselves. No more reliance on incomplete public records or risking that family books are lost. This digital master record can help identify and connect to one's past-- sharing culture, experiences and stories.

## Family Health
We all go to the doctor and are asked about the various health risks our family (sometimes 2+ generations) has. While this is a sensitive area to discuss and share, offspring and future generations can benefit from an understanding of living habits, medical issues, mental health, causes of death, etc of their forefathers. 

While not an exhaustive list, it's interesting to see how we are so focused on data's use and value today but might forget its future benefit. While unnerving to some, everything about us will be available for the benefit and use of future generations.
