Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

So I decided to come down to my parents' house in Maryland for some R&R this weekend. After my failed attempts to make it down south last weekend, thought it would be a good, quick get-a-way. I ended up trying to get Octave to work for hours and ended up abandoning it for UI/UX research and design. As you know, I am running a <a href="goo.gl/nCAGYw" target="_blank">survey</a> that I would be grateful if you participated in (and pass on to friends) -- you could win an Amazon gift card! So basically, I didn't relax in the traditional sense but did tinker and learn with little in the form of distraction.

With that, this week's selection of readings:

* **<a href = "http://hunterwalk.com/2014/07/09/for-startups-knowledge-is-a-commodity-but-insights-are-valuable/" target ="_blank">Insights, Not Just Facts</a>**. I feel like I haven't been sharing enough on personal development-- this is a great way to pick it back up. Hunter Walk shares views on how people in all situations tend to be well versed with facts but rarely can turn them into insights. Useful for entrepreneurs, business leaders, those looking for great jobs and the occasional bar debate.

* **<a href = "http://blog.newprofit.com/?p=2432" target= "_blank">Interview with YCombinator's Head of Non Profits</a>**. The storied tech incubator has launched an effort to incubate social-focused start ups -- to apply the same skills, concepts and methods that work with start ups. This interview with Kate Courteau is a great read -- insightful and useful for those who think their work skills can't translate into the nonprofit world or to catalyze social innovation. Part 2 is available <a href = "http://blog.newprofit.com/?p=2487" target= "_blank">here</a>.

* **<a href = "http://abovethecrowd.com/2014/07/11/how-to-miss-by-a-mile-an-alternative-look-at-ubers-potential-market-size/" target="_blank">Valuing Uber - An Alternative Look at TAM</a>**. Uber investor Bill Gurley penned this long but well thought-out piece on his view of Uber's valuation. It was in response to NYU Professor and Valuation "Guru" Aswath Damodaran's analysis. Take a read for yourself, it takes one back to those Finance 101 classes with discussions around assumptions. I myself am not totally sold on the $1.4 T TAM but do think that Uber will ultimately be very successful. Read it with an open mind... could learn a lot but will also likely question a lot.

* **<a href = "http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/7/10/unbundling-innovation" target="_blank">Understanding OEM "Customization" of Android</a>**. Ben Evans pens a great post that explains how Android is not necessarily as "open" to innovation as it may seem. He details the dynamics (and potential uphill battle) of the Amazon Fire "fork" and how the original promise for OEMs to tailor Android has not entirely worked out.

* **<a href = "http://tomtunguz.com/trends-in-acquisition-market/" target="_blank">Trends in Startup M&A </a>**. A great Crunchbase-sourced analysis of the trends occurring in the venture-backed M&A market. A short, succinct piece with some great visuals.

* **<a href = "http://avc.com/2014/07/checking-your-work/" target="_blank">Checking Your Work</a>**. Ah an extra! Another self development piece... this is something all my teachers and parents always told me... "Check and double check, Santosh... don't rush!" I have gotten MUCH better at it but I still will find myself thinking about how long something took me and how much longer it will take to check. But more often than not, those things that require long, complex calculations and thought are best reviewed later with a fresh set of eyes. Sadly, this is not always a viable option. Check out Fred's post-- great reinforcement of a lesson once learned.

Well, off to get a workout and prep for the World Cup game. Let's go Germany! As always, a share or retweet would be much appreciated.
