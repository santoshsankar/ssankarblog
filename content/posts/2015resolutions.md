Summary: My 2015 New Year's Resolutions

Happy New Year! I've spent the better part of this first week fighting a nasty sinus infection, due to which, I've had time to set my resolutions. I've always preached the importance of reflection and based on my 2014 accomplishments, here's what I plan for 2015...

1. **Get Back in Shape**. Drop 10 pounds and workout every day- sweet and simple
2. **New job, New location**. Land a role in product management that is accretive to my long-term career goal, preferably in a new locale, by March. I've been in NYC for almost 5 years, I think I've had my fill
3. **Launch my first iOS App**. I've been diligently taking two iOS classes and am in the process of building my first app. I would like to get this launched in Q1 and iterate throughout the year (aiming for 2-3 iterations)
4. **Write More.** I became less disciplined with writing as 2014 progressed and as such, want to write at least 3x/week, spending no more than 30 mins, excluding my Sunday piece
5. **Read More.** I lost a great habit, reading. While I likely read several novels a week based on my online consumption, I am more focused on books. I am going to aim for 1 book every 2 weeks

Short and sweet with clear, (mostly) quantitative benchmarks. Now it's time to get started on these.
