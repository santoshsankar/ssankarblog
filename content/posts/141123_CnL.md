Well up here in NYC, the Christmas decorations are coming out with some public properties already lighting up lamp posts and wreaths. That's my sign that it is ok to breakout the Christmas playlists, specifically the Michael Buble Christmas album-- already a classic in my opinion. Picked up quite a few interesting tidbits this week along with some cool products including a luxury, eco-friendly and high-tech treehouse as well as a personal butler.

If you do find an interesting article or product on here, please <a href="http://twitter.com/home?status= " target="_blank">share</a> this with your family and friends.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/programmers-price" target="_blank">What's A Programmer Cost?</a>** An interesting piece on the cost of programmers and high-stakes hunt for engineering talent that has given rise to "agents" or "nerd whisperers." The "precation" perk and salaries seem similar to perks found in finance and consulting. For those of you wondering, the hourly salary mentioned equates to $300-$600k annually, by my estimates assuming an above-average work week

* **<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141117154558-1213-the-future-of-the-bitcoin-ecosystem-and-trustless-trust-why-i-invested-in-blockstream" target="_blank">Investing in the Future of Blockchain</a>**. Reid Hoffman (who's latest interview is linked to below) describes why he has invested in Blockstream- to advance the development of the blockchain. I'm very high on blockchain, the centrally located, community-managed ledger that Bitcoin uses. I think it's great to see some folks invest money (even if initially uneconomic) to mature the technology which could result in a whole crop of businesses developing new technologies and uses for the blockchain

* **<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20141117164152-2157554-building-habit-forming-products-an-interview-with-nir-eyal" target="_blank">Building Habit Forming Products</a>**. Nir Eyal, the author of bestselling book *Hooked* which discusses thoughts around psychology, behavior, emotion, design and experience in the product development process. Eyal relied on his years of experience as well as research using today's popular products to develop his perspectives. I am currently reading his book and will revert with "lessons learned"

* **<a href = "http://hunterwalk.com/2014/11/18/the-most-difficult-question-i-ask-founders/" target="_blank">The Most Difficult Question I Ask Founders - Hunter Walk</a>**. For those of us aspiring to help building companies, Hunter Walk is someone we can learn a lot from. He shares what he believes is the hardest question he asks founders- why? To back up his views/perspective, here is the <a href="http://hunterwalk.com/2013/08/22/the-why-of-homebrew/" source="_blank">Why</a> of Homebrew

* **<a href = "https://hbr.org/2014/11/what-airbnb-uber-and-alibaba-have-in-common
" target="_blank">HBR Study on Why Network Orchestrators Get a Premium Valuation</a>**. Interesting study from Harvard trying to parse out why Network Orchestrators like Facebook, Airbnb or Alibaba get the hefty valuations they do. As with any valuation study, take this with a grain of salt since there seems to be a lot of assumptions going into the categorization of companies between the four major business model buckets. I for one question that Nike is a "network orchestrator" just because of Nike+ which likely results in little if any additional profits. In any case, an interesting piece to mull over a cup of coffee (or tea)

* **<a href = "https://hbr.org/2014/11/what-airbnb-uber-and-alibaba-have-in-common
" target="_blank">The Future of VR and Chrome</a>**. A one-on-one interview with the only person at Google working on web-based virtual reality, Brandon Jones. This is pretty exciting stuff, imagine an immersive experience rooted in everyday hardware (laptop) with a free app (Chrome)-- pretty cool idea. To give credit where it's due, Mozilla has been working on this for quite a while

* **<a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNuYE80m-00" target="_blank">Candid Interview with Reid Hoffman, Co-founder of LinkedIn</a>**. This is a great interview of Reid Hoffman from Jason Calacanis' This Week in Startups. Hoffman offers advice on startup strategies, lessons he has learned as well as insight gleaned from pioneering and creating social networks
 
## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://www.sleepinatree.co" target="_blank">The Treehouse Project</a>**. While this is here as a product, The Treehouse Project is really aspiring to be a company focused on building luxurious, treehouses for outdoor lovers. A really cool idea that is currently funding on Kickstarter-- highly recommend checking it out. The first treehouse will be located right outside of Chattanooga and will even have gigabit internet!

* **<a href = "https://www.helloalfred.com/" target="_blank">Alfred</a>**. For $25, you can have your own butler that manages those repetitive, mundane personal tasks. This includes laundry and even picking up groceries to make sure your fridge and pantry are stocked up. For me, this might come in handy given I often struggle to find time during the week for basic chores

* **<a href = "http://www.watchville.co/" target="_blank">Watchville</a>**. Kevin Rose's North's second app in a matter of a few months which covers all aspects of the watch world. He became hooked to watches after receiving his dad's Rolex as a gift which was compounded after spending time in Germany and seeing how they're made. With a big push for smartwatches coming out 

* **<a href = "https://greenchef.com/" target="_blank">Green Chef</a>**. Another food delivery startup in what I think is becoming an increasingly crowded space. The differentiating factor is that Green Chef seems to be catering to the underserved regions primarily in the West, Mountain and Midwest regions of the country. If you live there, give it a try and let me know how it is

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bionic-bird-the-furtive-drone" target="_blank">Bionic Bird</a>**. A really cool smartphone-controlled bird drone. With soon-to-be-added stationary flight and on-board HD video capabilities, Bionic Bird is a civilian drone inspired by our avian friends. While the timeline seems aggressive, this could be quite a cool toy (or holiday gift)
