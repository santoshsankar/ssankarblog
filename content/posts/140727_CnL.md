Summary: A selection of articles from around the web focused on business, tech, products, product management, entrepreneurship, leadership, VC, growth and angel investing.

Spent the weekend up in the Shawgunk Mountains here in New York and couldn't be more excited to get today's edition of Coffee & Links out. Like I said last week, I have a permanent addition to the post- *Pastries & Products*. Yeah, might be a bit tacky to stick with the coffee shop theme- ow well. With the section, I will showcase the most interesting products I found during the week. Given I spend a good chunk of time looking at new and innovate products and with the rise of Product Hunt, figured I woud share my thoughts.

## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "https://stripe.com/blog/bitcoin-the-stripe-perspective" target ="_blank">Stripe's Perspective on Bitcoin</a>**. For about a year now, Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies have been featured in the lionshare of financial-related headlines. Payments startup, Stripe offers their two cents on the issue and let me say, this is a well thought out, cohesive perspective on the topic.

* **<a href = "http://recode.net/2014/07/23/can-startups-create-blue-collar-jobs-in-america/" target= "_blank">Startups Creating Blue-Collar Jobs</a>**. I'm a huge fan of the startups that have rethought and innovated many of the age-old, high cost, time consuming and manual industries of past. Sam Rosen, CEO of MakeSpace visits this dynamic and shows how high tech can actually benefit blue-collar communities by being a force of job creation. Think on the terms of drivers for Uber, food delivery personnel for Fresh Direct, sanitation jobs for Homejoy or even movers for MakeSpace.

* **<a href = "http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/12/software-entrepreneurs-must-go-mobile-first-or-die/" target="_blank">Develop for Mobile or Die</a>**. Mobile-first has essentially become the status quo for start ups launching these days. Starting with consumer, the trend has caught on to enterprise. Roger Lee of Battery Ventures has some guidelines entrepreneurs should consider when developing mobile products and establishing a mobile-centric business.

* **<a href = "http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/07/22/the-changing-structure-of-the-vc-industry/" target="_blank">The Development of the VC Industry</a>**. Probably the most popular post in the venture community this week and rightfully so. I embedded the SlideShare below but please read Suster's post highlighting the salient points of his research. Fred Wilson also complemented the post with his <a href = "http://avc.com/2014/07/the-pro-rata-opportunity/" target="_blank">thoughts</a> on the pro-rate opportunity and how USV has captured upside in successful investments using pro ratas. A must read this week.

* **<a href = "http://mashable.com/2014/07/21/million-dollar-idea/?utm_cid=mash-com-li-pete-link" target="_blank">Brainstorming Great Ideas</a>**. This is a great Quora repost on Mashable and I think it's a great way to actively *think about how one thinks*. Check it out and try using it as a framework as you approach problem solving, new feature generation, new business generation or in any other situation.

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hello/sense-know-more-sleep-better/" target="_blank">Sense</a>**. A sleep sensor/monitor, the Sense is a cool, hardware product that sits on your bedside and with the use of a "pill," monitors your sleep. It considers a myriad of factors including: noise, temperature and movement, among others things. By monitoring your sleep pattern, it wakes you up at the optimal point of your cycle. Users can interface with the product using an app. I ended up funding this product for two reasons: 1) it not only tells you that you are/are not sleeping well, it tells you why-- head, humidity, noise, movement, etc. so you can take action to fix it. Now, with my FitBit, not only do I need to wear it but it does not identify *why* my sleep is disrupted, just that it is disrupted, 2) form factor. The fact one does not need to wear it is pretty cool but the look of the Sense really is awesome. It's a cool, Bird's Nest-looking device that can "fade-away" into the background of the bedroom. Since it's not attached to any one person, using the pills, the Nest can trace more than one person's sleep in the room, say a spouse. I am excited by this device and believe that it has a great future-- I look forward to receiving it in November.
* **<a href = "https://www.thinknum.com/" target="_blank">Thinknum</a>**. Given I work in finance, I thought this is awesome. Thinknum allows people to collaborate to build and share their financial models in the cloud. For all my data junkies, number crunchers and finance experts, this could be something of interest. It allows you to pull in data and build valuation and financial models for thousands of publicly listed companies. It has a set of models to begin with but one could start from scratch if they wish. I think in the long-term the equity research and banking businesses will evolve to use or even get "eaten" by something similar to this.

* **<a href = "http://static.gotenna.com/" target="_blank">GoTenna</a>**. I funded this idea a couple weeks ago after introducing it on Product Hunt. I love the whole idea of disrupting the existing telcos and improving the wireless service we get. I think GoTenna is working towards that. It's an antenna that interfaces with a mobile phone using Bluetooth LE and depending on the device elevation, it can interface with other users with a GoTenna for miles around it. Currently, it's particularly useful in areas where service is poor or even as a backup network (maybe like ham radios). As more GoTenna's are in the wild, we benefit from network effects-- communicate with more individuals that have one. Additionally, we also benefit from the mesh network of connectivity that is built in the process. While it will initially launch with text messaging, it has the ability to share other types of data. Give it a try, could be useful for hiking, travel, sporting events or emergencies.

* **<a href = "http://goodst.org/" target="_blank">Good Street</a>**. A great way of promoting social innovation. Good Street sends out the cause of the day, allows a user to select a charity addressing the cause and then shows the impact of their contribution. The great part is that one can sign up for as low as 25 cents a day! That may not sound like much but with the power of crowds that small sum can go a long way. It's great to purchase cool products and build great businesses but we should also remember the blessed position we're in and contribute in order to help those in need.

* **<a href = "http://destroyer.io/" target="_blank">Destroyer.io</a>**. This product caught my eye on Product Hunt because of my dad. Growing up, the few times we replaced a computer, I had the task of taking the hard drive out and saving it. Why? Because there is data on it that could be misused. Destroyer.io provides a guaranteed service that takes care of that. Now will my dad use it? Who knows- the generational differences could suggest he might not but then again, the 100% guaranteed data destruction is awesome. Regardless, I sure would.

Hopefully the new Pastries & Products addition opens your eyes to some new products and my high level view was helpful. I urge everyone to check out Product Hunt, Kickstarter or Indiegogo and see what great new things entrepreneurs and innovators are working on. As always, a share or retweet would be much appreciated.
