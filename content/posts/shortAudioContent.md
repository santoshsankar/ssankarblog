Summary: While I get that visuals are important and awesome, there's something to be said about the ease of capturing and sharing short, unfiltered audio.

Since the inception of the internet, "print" has been the primary medium we've used to share information- set up a simple web page and you were good to go. This has evolved now to things like blogs, posts and Tweets, among other things. It's been estimated that as of 2013, over 60% of everything we consume daily is text-based (1). 

The rise of social media also brought forth the easy creation, distribution and curation of short video content (both ephemeral and ever-lasting) through apps like Snapchat, Instagram and/or Vine. 

While I get that visuals are important and awesome, there's something to be said about the *ease of capturing and sharing short, unfiltered audio*. Not to mention, in a world where wireless data costs remain high, audio can still offer satisfactory experiences. 

## Short Audio- Feature or Product?

A way to share short audio clips (< 1 min) could be interesting. Now whether this is a feature or a full-fledged, standalone offering, currently, I am indifferent.  

* **Feature:** while it could be on any existing platform, I have to say that I'm biased to the idea of a voice tweet - sounds pretty cool
* **Stand-alone App:** it might be more of a niche-play vs mainstream, but it could replace short text with short sound bits

I think this would also capture the trend where increasingly, people are speaking to their phones to compose text-- why not just capture their voice? I would be interested to hear other thoughts and ideas out there on this topic

*Note: To fully acknowledge efforts, apps like WhatsApp and iMessage do have short audio capture features, allowing for both written and audio messages.*
