Summary: When required to make a choice, I opted to carry my phone over my wallet. These are my observations and self realization as it relates to mobile payments and identity as I spent a day running errands around town.

This past weekend, I was out of town and parted with my wallet for my phone due to a limited amount of pocket space. My wallet was kept safely in a purse and given to me whenever I needed it. *I faced many inconveniences but I learned one thing, my subconscious decision to ditch my wallet for my phone shows that my wallet is losing its significance to my smartphone.*

As a note, I generally don't use my phone for payments and the places I visited, from my what I recall, did not have that capability. Furthermore, my Android does not have anything that facilitates official identification for the purchase of beer, wine or to simply drive. 

I visited six brick and mortar establishments: Target, Dick's Sporting Goods, Best Buy, Whole Foods, Eastern Mountain Sports, a sandwich joint and a boutique clothing shop. Among the issues I had that required my wallet: 
* ID for credit purchases, 
* validating my age for a bottle of wine,
* having to leave line to get my wallet for payment, 
* forgetting if I had a rewards account at a retailer I rarely frequent (since I live in NYC)
* having to dig through my wallet to use my HSA card for qualifying purchases

The two points underpinning my aforementioned issues:

1. No consistent mobile payments framework and ecosystem
2. No verified and reliable identification system

We've come far with commerce, online payments, customer rewards and in-app payments but mobile payments still has a ways to go. There have been some great efforts and "hacks"-- not to poo-poo them but the mobile wallet -- both payments and identification-- is still up for grabs.

The differing opinions and competitive efforts (while awesome), have resulted in a fragmented ecosystem and a lack of standards. **Where there's fragmentation in an essential, building-block-type service, there's room for innovation and leadership.** Here's to hoping that in the next few years, I can totally ditch my wallet and both pay and identify myself through mobile (or wearables).
