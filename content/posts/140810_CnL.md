## Coffee & Links

* **<a href = "http://blog.samaltman.com/stupid-apps-and-changing-the-world" target="_blank">Stupid Apps and Changing the World</a>.** My favorite piece this week and augments the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-08-07/silicon-valley-tech-entrepreneurs-behind-the-stereotype#r=hp-ls" target="_blank">cover story</a> of Businessweek. Give it a read-- "The internet commenters and journalists that say you’re working on something that doesn’t matter are probably not building anything at all themselves."

* **<a href = "http://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/08/08/four-ways-founders-anyone-else-break-investing/" target="_blank">Four Ways One Could Break Into Early Stage Investing</a>**. A post penned by Semil Shah on various ways (all difficult) one could launch a career in early stage investing. While AngelList has added a new dynamic and allowed individuals easier access to opportunities, it's still challenging. But hey, if it's a dream and the end goal, there are ways to achieve it. Take a read and start planning!

* **<a href = "http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/07/31/trouble-crowdfunding-interesting-product-blinds-red-flags/" target="_blank">Crowdfunding Red Flags</a>**. After my <a href=" " target="_blank">piece</a> last week on my process to crowdfunding, I thought this was quite timely- a piece with recent example around red flags in a crowdfunding campaign. A great read for anyone considering to contribute to a campaign. It's important to be aware of risks and any red flags that might come up when reviewing an opportunity.

* **<a href = "http://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/3-design-lessons-from-spotifys-master-designer.html?cid=sf01001" target="_blank">Three Design Tips from Spotify's Van Schneider</a>**. I'm a big fan of Spotify's Design Chief, Tobias van Schneider. Check this interview with him where he outlines the three main design tips he believes were core to Spotify's success.

* **<a href = "http://www.slideshare.net/500startups/06-mike-greenfield-lasarlike-final" target="_blank">A/B Testing</a>**. Before even getting submerged in the product world, I considered testing to be the most intuitive concept to observe the uptake and aide in the development of new features. I think this SlideShare is a succinct introduction into A/B testing. Embedded below for your convenience-

* **<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4vsjP_sKTo" target="_blank">5 Areas That Will Impact Humanity the Most - Elon Musk</a>**. I just discovered this video that LinkedIn CEO, Jeff Weiner tweeted out. About 45 minutes but perfect to have one in the background on this lovely Sunday (I listened to it on Friday while cleaning).

## Pastries & Products

* **<a href = "http://datamonkey.pro/" target="_blank">Data Monkey</a>**. A free, easy-to-follow,  online crash course to SQL for data analysis. Long time coming. I highly suggest everyone to give it a shot-- the lessons go by quickly and can be applied in a variety of careers and use cases. Data analysis isn't just for mathematicians, researchers or business analysts.

* **<a href = "https://checkup.frontapp.com/" target="_blank">The Inbox Checkup</a>**. This is a fun but useful utility that queries your Gmail activity to create an activity summary. Since I can't use my Gmail for work, much of my activity is untracked but it could be useful for those who can. Use it to see, among other things, reply %, read % and to track how many emails you send per day on average. Data-driven email communication, anybody?

* **<a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aersf/aer-duffel-pack-the-gym-bag-for-the-modern-lifesty" target="_blank">Aer Duffel Pack</a>**. I'm really split on this. I think that a design such as this was a long time coming-- combining the work and gym bag. However, I would also prefer the traditional duffel handle in addition to the backpack straps. If you're wearing a blazer or coat in the winter, the backpack style doesn't work too well. This could work for those in warmer climates, check it.

* **<a href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/matchbook-save-remember-great/id427740544?mt=8" target="_blank">Matchbook</a>**. A great app that allows one to save restaurants and bars that they either 1) enjoy and want to return to or 2) that they find interesting and want to remember to try. Living in NYC, I often find places I want to try but end up forgetting about them. Matchbook helps solve that problem. Matchbook also offers recommendations based on your bookmarks, so more bookmarks, more relevant recommendations. Super useful, give it a try, it's currently only available for iOS.

* **<a href = "https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/patchnride-bicycle-flat-tire-repair/x/7493200" target="_blank">patchnride</a>**. This caught my eye after spending three years watching my roommate fix blown bicycle tires. He orders tubes in bulk and spends hundreds of dollars a year on tires. While patchnride is a single-use product, it can save a considerable sum of money for all those bicyclists both here in NYC and around the world.
